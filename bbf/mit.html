			<h3>Boston By Foot</h3>
			<p>Welcome to the MIT Architecture tour.  This is a 90 minute walk around part of the central campus.  We'll finish up in the next building over, under the great dome.</p>
            <p>Boston By Foot is a non-profit educational organization.  It was founded in 1976, to promote public awareness of Boston's historical and architectural heritage.  We offer a variety of tours of Boston, which are described in the brochure that I gave you (wave it).  Boston By Foot has around two hundred volunteer tour guides.</p>

			<h3>MIT History</h3>
            <p>MIT was chartered in 1861, and started classes in 1865, in rented space in Boston.  It moved into a new building of its own Back Bay in 1866.</p>
            <p>MIT had the first architecture program in America, starting in 1865.</p>
            <p>MIT was known as "Boston Tech".  It slowly expanded around Copley Square during the 19th century.  By 1902 it had a combined student and staff population of 1500.  It was a commuter school with no dormitories.</p>
            <p>MIT began looking for space to expand.  In 1904 an agreement was reached to merge MIT into Harvard as the School of Engineering, but that was rejected by the MIT communiity.</p>
            <p>In 1912 MIT bought vacant made land along the Charles River from the City of Cambrige.  MIT build a new campus on that land and moved there in  1916, with elaborate ceremonies.  Last year MIT celebrated the 100th anniversary of the move.</p>
            <p>Today MIT has 4500 undergraduate students, 6800 graduate students, and 3700 researchers.  Undergraduates have the opportunity to participate in research projects through UROP.</p>

			<h3>Rogers Building (7)</h3>
            <p>We are standing in the Rogers building, also known as Building 7 in MIT's numbering scheme.  This building opened in 1937.  It was designed by William Welles Bosworth and Harry J. Carlson.</p>
            <p>Bosworth had designed the 1916 campus.  This building has a dome and atrium, like Building 10 in the 1916 campus design.</p>
            <p>This is now main entrance to MIT, and one end of the "infinite corridor" that runs east from here.</p>
            <p>At two different times each year, the sun aligns with the Massachussets Institute of Technology's (MIT) "Infinite Corridor".  They call it "MIThenge".  During these times, the sun can be seen down the entire length of the hallway.</p>

            <h3>The Alchemist</h3>
            <p>This is <em>The Alchemist</em> by Jaume Plensa from 2010.  This is actually one of three similar works by Plensa from that year.  All three are made of stainless steel symbols painted white and arranged in the shape of a person sitting with knees drawn up to the chest.</p>
            <p>The other two are made up of letters of the alphabet.  This one is created from numeric symbols, as an “homage to all the researchers and scientists“ that have contributed to scientific and mathematical knowledge.</p>
            <p>The piece is illuminated from the inside.  Feel free to step in and view if from within.  But they do ask that you no touch it.</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Stratton Student Center</h3>
            <p>This is the Stratton Student Center.  It was designed by Eduardo Catalano and completed in 1965.  Catalano was on the faculty at the time.</p>
            <p>This is one of a wave of Brutalist designs appearing at MIT, and in Boston, during the 1960's.  Like Boston City Hall, it is constructed of reinforced concrete.</p>
            <p>The concrete color of the Stratton Student Center is sympathetic to the limestone exteriors of the older campus buildings.</p>
            <p>And like Boston City Hall, its dramatic exterior features express the functions within.</p>
            <p>The building contains social rooms, dining areas, student activities offices, music rooms and recreational and commercial facilities.  The fourth floor and fifth floors are home to the more than 200 MIT clubs and organizations.</p>

            <h3>Eero Saarinen</h3>
            <p>Eero Saarinen was the son of Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen.  Elial moved from Finland to the United States when Eero was 13, and ended up living near Detroit where he designed the Cranbrook Academy campus.</p>
            <p>Eero started out working for his father on the Cranbrook campus.  His first major commission of this own was the Saint Louis Arch in 1947.</p>
            <p>Eero Saarinen designed both the MIT Chapel and Kresge Auditorium.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Kresge Auditorium</h3>
            <p>Kresge Auditorium was completed in 1955.  The initial model for the dome was the skin from a section of grapefruit that had been cut into eight pieces.</p>
            <p>The dome is one-eighth of a sphere, resting on three support points.  It is 50 feet tall at the center.  It made of thin shell reinforced concrete.  The structural layer ranges from 3 to 7 inches thick.</p>
            <p>Originally, the exterior was white, made from find limestone chips in a liquid acrylic binder.  There was a series of problems and attempts are repairs, culminating with copper cladding in 1979.</p>
            <p>The interior is structurally independent of dome.  It contains 1200 seat theater, with no support beams obstructing views.</p>
            <p>There is a lower level with asmaller theater, rehearsal rooms, and offices.</p>

            <h3>MIT Chapel</h3>
            <p>The MIT Chapel was completed in 1954.  It is a cylinder with a rectangular narthex.</p>
            <p>The cylinder does not have conventional windows.  Light enters from above through a circular skylight, and indirectly through hidden horizontal windows along the wall.  Light reflects off the water in the moat and up through those windows.</p>
            <p>The exterior is brick, in contrast to the concrete and steel of its neighbors.  The interior wall is undulating brick.</p>
            <p>Instead of a conventional steeple, the chapel is topped by the <i>Bell Tower</i>, a sculpture by Theodore Roszak.  Its three vertical elements represent Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism.</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Sports Centers</h3>
            <p>The Johnson Athletics Center was designed by Davis and Brody, and completed in 1980.  Its second story mass, comprising 50,000 square foot field house, is lifted above a smaller volume on cruciform piers.  There are exterior stairs on the far side that are reminiscent Baker House, which is our next stop.</p>
            <p>The Zesiger Sports and Fitness Center was designed by Kevin Roche and opened in 2002.  Early in his career he worked for Eero Saarinen.</p>

            <h3>Simmons Hall</h3>
            <p>Simmons Hall was designed by Steven Holl and opened in 2002.  It is a 10 story building, but it's hard to tell because of the unconventional windows.  There are 5500 2 ft by 2 ft windows.  Each residential room has a tic-tac-toe pattern of nine operable windows.</p>
            <p>The exterior is made of pre-cast sections, each one story high and five columns wide.</p>
            <p>The structural engineers color coded their drawings to indicate the differences in structural reinforcement in each section.  The architect was so impressed with the look of the drawings that he decided to replicate this color scheme on the aluminum cladding.</p>
            <p>Close to 40% of the space in this building is devoted to community use.  Holl has created a series of community spaces throughout the building which penetrate several floors and provide dramatic cave like quarters for students to gather for study and socialization.</p>
            <p>The architect designed all of the furniture within the rooms.  This is another example of archtiecture as social engineering.</p>

            <h3>Residential Towers</h3>
            <p>The buildings along the left and at the far end of the athletic fields are student residences.</p>
            <p>The residential tower straight ahead is Westgate Tower.  It was designed by Hugh Stubbins and Associates, and opened in 1963.</p>
            <p>The Brutalist tower to the left of Westgate is Tang Residence Hall, also by Hugh Stubbins and Associates.  It opened in 1972.</p>
            <p>The tower nearer us is part of MacGregor House, which was deisgned Pietro Belluschi and The Architects Collaborative.  It opened in 1970.</p>

			<h3>McCormick Hall</h3>
            <p>The pair of buildings across the street are McCormick Hall, which houses undergraduate women.  Both buildings were designed by Herbert Beckwith (faculty member).  The West building opened in 1963 and the East building in 1967.</p>
		</div>
		<div data-role="collapsible">
			<h3>Baker House</h3>
            <p>Baker House was designed by Alvar Alto, another Finnish architect, and opened in 1947.  It was extensively restored in 2002 by Perry Dean Rogers.</p>
            <p>Aalto allowed the river to determine the striking form of the building.  The W shape provides views up and down stream as well as across the river.  It also maximized sunlight on south side. </p>
            <p>The main entrance is here on north side.  The cantilevered double staircase forms a V shape.</p>
            <p>All the Baker House furniture was designed by Aalto with the collaboration of his wife.</p>

			<h3>Tidal Estuary</h3>
            <p>Originally, this was a tidal estuary.  Fresh water flowed downstream at low tide.  But at hide tide, salt water from the harbor backed up into here.  The river effectively reversed direction with each change of the tide.</p>
            <p>The water level varied with the tide. So the river was wider at high tide than at low tide. At high tide, it was two miles wide, stretching from Washington Street in the South End to Central Square in Cambridge.</p>
            <p>The original shoreline here consisted of tidal mudflats and marshes that were underwater at high tide and exposed at low tide. There was a cove here, extending inland at high tide almost to Central Square.  We are standing on made land.</p>

			<h3>Cambridge Embankment</h3>
            <p>One man was responsible for the transformation of the Cambridge bank of the Charles along here.  Charles Davenport made his fortune in the 1840's manufacturing omnibuses and railroad passenger cars.</p>
            <p>He became a founder of the Grand Junction Railroad, which built tracks from Brookline through Cambridge and Somerville in the 1850's.  The track was mostly on a high embankment.  It straightened out the shoreline.</p>
            <p>He later founded the Charles River Embankment Company, which purchased the flats between the West Boston and Cottage Farm bridges.  In 1882 the company reached an agreement with Cambridge to make land.  It began constructing a seawall and filling behind it.</p>
            <p>The plan was to create a residential district, the Cambridge version of Boston's Back Bay.  But this did not work out, and the company went bankrupt in 1893.  The made land was deeded to Cambridge.</p>
            <p>The made land remained almost entirely empty.  They did build the Charles River Road along the shoreline, which was renamed Memorial Drive in 1923 for WWI dead.</p>

            <h3>Harvard Bridge</h3>
            <p>The Harvard Bridge was designed by Boston City Engineer William Jackson and completed in 1891.  It was named in honor of John Harvard, founder of Harvard College.</p>
            <p>The bridge originally had a swing span in the center, which was removed in 1924.</p>
            <p>The project also create Massachusetts Avenue here.</p>

			<h3>Riverbank Court Hotel</h3>
            <p>This is one of the few buildings constructed on the made land before MIT moved in.  When it opened in 1900 it was named the Riverbank Court Hotel.</p>
            <p>It was designed by Henry B. Ball &amp; H.E. Davidson in the Tudor Revival style.  MIT purchased it in 1937 and converted it to student housing.</p>
            <p>After a major rennovation, this building reopened in 2011 as Maseeh Hall, and undergraduate residence.  Previously it had been Ashdown House, a graduate student residence.</p>

        <h1>1916 Campus</h1>
        <a href="#mcdermott">Next</a>
    </div>
    <div data-role="content">
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Bosworth</h3>
            <p>MIT moved to Cambridge in 1916.  The new campus was call the "New Tech".  It was designed by William Welles Bosworth, a 1889 graduate.</p>
            <p>While still a student, Bosworth worked part time as a draftsman for H.H. Richardson.   After graduating, he worked for Frederick Law Olmstead on the design for the Stanford University campus.  He went on to study at the famous École des Beaux-Arts from 1896 to 1900.</p>
            <p>Bosworth was appointed architect for the "New Tech" in 1913.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Layout</h3>
            <p>This is the "main group" of buildings in the 1916 campus.  The conventional campus design at the time was free standing building around a quad.  Bosworth chose to have continuously connected buildings organized on formal axes.</p>
            <p>This arrangement had a couple practical advantages.  Student would not have to travel outside between buildings in bad weather.  And the connectedness helped to reduce departmental boundaries.</p>
            <p>The style is Beaux-Arts classicism.  The dome is inspired by the Pantheon in Rome.  Like the Boston Public Library, names are engraved on the exterior, but names from science and engineering rather than the humanities.</p>
            <p>The two symmetric wings enclose a central court, with two side courts.  The wings step up in height as they go from the river to the dome.</p>
            <p>The ensemble is symmetric about the axis that runs from the dome to the river.  The courtyard was originally paved, and terraced down to the river.  The original plan included a 50 foot tall statue of Minerva in the center of the courtyard.</p>
            <p>The courtyard was intended to be a gather place and center of activity in good weather, but that has not worked out.  The central axis of the campus is now the "infinite corridor", parallel to the river.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Construction</h3>
            <p>The construction is steel and concrete, with a limestone facing.  The architecture is abstract: exteriors do not express their interior function.</p>
            <p>In contrast to the exterior, the interior is more like industrial design.  Infrastructure is exposed.  The layout has proven to be flexible, and interiors have been rearranged to meet evolving laboratory needs.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Beaux Arts vs Skyscrapers</h3>
            <p>The 1916 campus represents a transitional phase in Boston architecture, from the Beaux-Arts aesthetic to the skyscraper aesthetic.  The exterior is Back Bay, while the interior is nearer Bauhaus.</p>
            <p>The Ames building in Boston was the tallest building on the east coast when it opened.  But skyscrapers became "banned in Boston" by an 1891 law limiting the height of future buildings to 125 feet.  Architects at the time supported that law, on aesthetics grounds.</p>
            <p>Those architects had been trained in the Beaux-Arts style, with its low even cornice line.  Over a generation, new architects came of age in the skyscraper era, and in the 1920's supported the repeal of the absolute height limit.  To borrow a phrase from the controversy over quantum mechanics at the same time, "architecture advances one funeral at a  time".</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Reclining Figure</h3>
            <p><i>Three-Piece Reclining Figure, Draped</i> was created by Henry Moore in 1976.  Moore began sculpting reclining figures in 1929.  During the 1960s Moore began to break his sculptures of reclining figures in two or three segments. </p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Guennette</h3>
            <p>This is <i>Guennette</i> by Michael Heizer from 1977.  The piece is composed of eleven slabs of billion-year-old pink granite mined in the northeastern Quebec town of Guennette.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Hayden Memorial Library</h3>
            <p>Hayden Memorial Library was designed by Ralph Walker (class of 1911) and opened in 1950.  Here you can see the progression of architecture at MIT from the main group building to Hayden to the Brutalist designs by I.M. Pei.</p>
            <p>The building's glass and limestone facades follow neo-classical rythms and attempt to bridge Bosworth's vision and a somewhat more modern expression.</p>
            <p>The windows are reversed from the Bosworth design, protruding instead of recessed.</p>
            <p>The building is a simple rectangle with an interior courtyard.  It is mostly occupied by libraries, plus a hall for musical performances.  Sculptures are to be found inside the building, in the courtyard, and outside on the river side of the buildling.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Walker Memorial</h3>
            <p>Walker Memorial was also part of the 1916 campus, and designed by Bosworth.  It was originally a student dining and recreation center.</p>
            <p>The side facing the river, with its broad steps and columnns, is reminiscent of the original MIT building in Back Bay.</p>
            <p>Walker Memorial contains the first permanently installed work of art at MIT, a series of didactic murals by Edwin H. Blashfield (class of 1869): Alma Mater (1923) on north wall, Chemist and Humanity (1930) on south wall.</p>

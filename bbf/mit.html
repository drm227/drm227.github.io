            <p>Bosworth design had large assembly hall under dome; due to lack of funds, space was partitioned into lobby, lecture hall (10-250) and library</p>

            <p>Pantheon in Rome; 100 foot diameter dome; rotunda is 75 feet wide and high; the two meet in a 27 foot diameter oculus (same as Pantheon); enclosed by two layers of glass</p>

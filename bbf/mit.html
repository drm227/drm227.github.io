            <h3>The Alchemist</h3>
            <p>Juame Piensa, installed 2010</p>
            <p>"Alchemist is related to Plensa’s other works, Nomade (2010) and El Alma Del Ebro (2010), which are made of randomly arranged stainless steel letters of the alphabet, painted white and arranged in the shape of a person sitting with knees drawn up to the chest."</p>
            <p>"However, in the place of letters of the alphabet, Plensa’s work for MIT is created from numeric symbols, as an “homage to all the researchers and scientists“ that have contributed to scientific and mathematical knowledge."</p>

            <p>"dramatic cantilevers in concrete that express the structure of the building and the functions within, similar to the Boston City Hall"</p>
            <p>"The concrete color of the Stratton Student Center is sympathetic to the limestone exteriors of the older campus buildings."</p>
            <p>"social rooms, dining areas, student activities offices, music rooms and recreational and commercial facilities"</p>

            <h3>Kresge Auditorium</h3>
            <p>Eero Saarinen, 1953-1955</p>
            <p>shape of the building recalls the neoclassical domes of MacClaurin and Rogers buildings</p>
            <p>shell of the building, one-eighth of a sphere, floats free of the interior resting on three main support points</p>
            <p>The building roof is supported in only three places and is 3.5 inches thick in the middle and rises to a height of 50 feet.</p>
            <p>"The interior of the building, structurally independent of the roof, contains a 1200 seat auditorium that has no obstructed views as there are no interior supports. There is a smaller theater that seats approximately 200 as well as rehearsal rooms, dressing rooms, offices and lounges downstairs."</p>
            <p>"Keeping the dome watertight proved to be a difficult problem. Initially coated with a liquid applied waterproofing material, the building experienced continual leak problems due to expansion and contraction of the dome surface and numerous re-roofing schemes were tried until the present installation of copper shingles was installed in the 1960s."</p>

            <p>Eero Saarinen (St. Louis Gateway Arch), 1954</p>
            <p>"the windowless chapel has a rectangular narthex connected to a cylindrical chapel this is surrounded by a moat. The exterior brick contrasts with the concrete, steel, and glass of the other buildings in the oval."</p>
            <p>"The primary light sources are external. During the summer, when water is in the moat, the sunlight is reflected upward off the water through openings under the top of the brick arches at the base of the building, casting sparkling dots of light on the interior walls. In addition, light pours down from above thus illuminating from above and below the windowless chapel."</p>

            <p>Each one story high pre-cast section is five columns wide</p>
            <p>The structural engineers color coded their drawings to indicate the differences in structural reinforcement in each section and the architect was so impressed with the look of the drawings that he decided to replicate this color scheme on the aluminum cladding.</p>
            <p>the architect designed all of the furniture within the rooms.</p>
            <p>close to 40% of the space in this building is devoted to community use.  Holl has created a series of community spaces throughout the building which penetrate several floors and provide dramatic cave like quarters for students to gather for study and socialization.</p>

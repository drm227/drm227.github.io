            <h3>Boston By Foot</h3>
            <p>Welcome to the Fort Point Channel tour.  We will be talking about the channel, the land and buildings alongside it, and the bridges over it.  Today's tour will last 90 minutes, and we will walk a little over a mile.  The tour will end at Rolling Bridge Park where Dorchester Avenue crosses the channel.</p>
            <p>Boston By Foot is a non-profit educational organization.  It was founded in 1976, to promote public awareness of Boston's historical and architectural heritage.  We offer a variety of tours of Boston, which are described in the brochure that I gave you (wave it).  Boston By Foot has around two hundred volunteer tour guides.</p>

            <p>
                The load is transferred from the girders directly to the supporting piers.
                A haunched girder is deeper at the piers and shallower mid-span typically following a parabolic curve.
                Haunching increases the stiffness at mid-span to a a graceful aesthetic not found in thicker boxy girder bridges.
            </p>
            <p>
                The concrete is pre-stressed using pretensioned tendons.
                Tendons are steel cables pulled tight to form a straight line under high tension.
                Concrete is then cast around the tendons.  The tension on the tendons is released after the concrete hardens.
                The friction against the concrete prevents the tendons from moving, so the compression force is transferred from the tendons to the concrete.
                This puts the concrete itself under compression, giving it added strength.

                The bridge was designed with an above-water utility crossing in mind.  There are various pipes under the bridge.
                Some provide drainage from the roadway and others are rented space for utilities to connect South Boston and downtown.

            <p>“Shimmer” is a temporary public art installation by Fort Point artists Claudia Ravaschiere and Michael Moss. Using the refractive qualities of florescent and jewel toned plexi glass, this piece activates the the Congress Street Bridge and changes the public perception of a familiar urban environment.  The piece is constructed to catch the natural and ambient light to create a luminous field of color and alternating hues. The visual impact of the “Shimmer” will change as the light changes throughout the day.</p>

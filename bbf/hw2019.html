    1. Introduction
        A. Tour and BBF
            1. tour last 90 minutes ... finished at Batther Wharf in North End ... historic waterfront an ambiguous phrase ... Charlestown, East Boston, South Boston ... current shoreline, not original
        B. Colonial Waterfront
            1. C shape between Rowes Wharf and Lewis Wharf ... piecemeal landmaking by individual landowners ... wharfing out
            2. two larger projects changed appearance of cove
               Barricado 16?? ... defensive barrier ... fell into disrepair in 1700's
               Long Wharf 1711-1715 ... 1600 ft long ... started at Chatam Row ... end in deep water, beyond Barricado ... shorter now due to landmaking
        C. 19th Century Landmaking
            1. larger scale landmaking projects ... create blocks at a time ... south, west and north sections of cove
            2. Atlantic Ave project the last and largest ... creates street along path of Barricado between Rowes and Lewis ... we will follow that today
            3. Atlantic Avenue Project
            4. Fort Hill Project
            5. cutting down the hills to fill the coves

                today's waterfront created in that period

            <h3>Sponsors</h3>
            <p>Welcome to today's architecture boat tour presented by Boston By Foot and the Charles Riverboat Company and sponsored by the Boston Society of Architects. The BSA was founded in 1867 to enhance the practice of architecture and promote the understanding of design. Boston By Foot was founded in 1976 to promote the architecture and history of Boston through walking tours. We are celebrating our 40 anniversary this year.  I am one of more than 200 volunteer guides with Boston By Foot. We offer over 60 different guided walks covering a variety of neighborhoods and themes.  There are brochures available on the corner of the counter.</p>
        </div>

            <h3>Tour</h3>
            <p>Today we will start by heading down the Charles River and through the locks into the harbor.  We'll make a wide loop around the inner harbor and return to the locks.  Then we will cruise up the Charles past the Longfellow Bridge, turn around before the Harvard Bridge, and return to our starting point.  Since we'll be traveling in a big circle, we may pass some structures on the way out that we'll discuss on the way back, and vice versa.</p>

            <h3>Design of Built Environment</h3>
            <p>Today we will be talking about design - the design of Boston's <em class="highlight">built environment</em>.</p>
            <p>The built environment includes buildings we'll pass by, the bridge we'll pass under, and the locks we'll pass through.  In Boston, it also includes the land itself.  Most of land along the shoreline that we will pass is made land.</p>
            <p>So we'll be talking about architecture, landscape architecture, landmaking, and engineering.</p>

            <h3>Before &amp; After</h3>
            <p>The river between the Museum of Science and the BU Bridge is called the Charles River Basin.  What you see today is an artificial, man-made environment that bears little resemblance to the natural environment from which it was sculpted.</p>
            <p>Today, fresh water flows downstream through the Charles River Basin to the harbor.</p>
            <p>Originally, this was a tidal estuary.  Fresh water flowed downstream at low tide.  But at hide tide, salt water from the harbor backed up into here.  The river effectively reversed direction with each change of the tide.</p>
            <p>Today, the water level and width of the river remain constant.  The river is one third of a mile wide at the Harvard Bridge.</p>
            <p>Originally, the water level varied with the tide. So the river was wider at high tide than at low tide. At high tide, it was two miles wide, stretching from Washington Street in the South End to Central Square in Cambridge.</p>
            <p>Today, the shoreline is straight and lined with parkland.</p>
            <p>The original shoreline consisted of tidal mudflats and marshes that were underwater at high tide and exposed at low tide. It was not straight, but wound along bays, coves and points.</p>
            <p>Today, the river is used for recreational boating.  Previously, the traffic on the river was primarily commercial shipping.  Back then, all of the bridges opened to let ships through.  Nown there are only a couple bridges that still open.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Dam &amp; Embankment</h3>
            <p>The transformation of the Charles River Basin was not the result of a single project.  It evolved over decades.  The Boston and Cambridge sides developed independently.  Many plans for the basin were proposed, starting in the mid-19th century.  Several of these drew inspiration from the Alster Basin in Hamburg, Germany.  The plan that had the most influence on the ultimate result was one published in 1894 by landscape architect Charles Elliott.  Elliott  started out working as an apprentice for Olmstead.  In the 1890's he was appointed landscape architect for both the Boston and Cambridge park commissions.</p>
            <p>The biggest single step in the long transformation of the Charles Basin took place in 1910.  In that year the first Charles River Dam and Boston Embankment both opened.</p>
            <p>The Charles River Dam isolated the river from the tide, preventing salt water from flowing upstream into the basin.  Sluice gates in the dam were used to maintain the water level at a constant 8 feet above mean low tide (called grade 8).  The mud flats that had been exposed at low tide were now permanently under water.</p>
            <p>The Boston Embankment was created by building a concrete seawall and depositing fill dredged from the river behind it.  The Embankment was 300 feet wide between the Longfellow Bridge to the bend near Berkley Street, and 100 feet wide from there out to Charlesgate.</p>
            <p>We'll talk more about the development of the Esplanade later when we cruise upstream.</p>

            <h3>Lock</h3>
            <p>The Museum of Science sits on the 1910 Charles River Dam.  The earthen dam and the structures on it were designed by engineer Hiram Miller and architect Guy Lowell.  It had a lock here on the Boston side, and sluice gates on the Cambridge side.  The lock is 350 feet long and 45 feet wide.  There is an electrically operated sliding gate at each end.  The lock gates and sluice gates have been kept in the open position ever since the new dam opened downstream in 1978.</p>
            <p>There is a lock house on your right next to each gate, to protect the sliding lock mechanism.  The downstream lock house has a tower for the bridge tender.  It originally had a residence for the lock superintendent that was converted to a police station, now used by the state police.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Drawbridge</h3>
            <p>Immediately after exiting the lock, we will pass under the drawbridge for the Monsignor O'Brien Highway.  This is one of the bridges that still opens.  It is a double leaf bascule bridge.  When the bridge opens, each leaf turns on a hinge mechanism called a trunnion.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Viaduct</h3>
            <p>Immediately after the drawbridge we'll pass under the Lechmere Viaduct.  That's the concrete arch bridge that runs parallel to the highway, alongside the dam.  Look to your left for the best view.  The viaduct was built in 1912 to extend the Boston Elevated Railway over to East Cambridge.  Now it is used by the Green Line.  It was designed by Peabody & Stearns.</p>
            <p>The viaduct has 12 arches.  All of them are made of concrete except for the one we passed under.  It was originally a double leaf bascule bridge.  It has since been replaced by a steel fixed span.</p>
            <p>The Lechmere Viaduct served another purpose besides extending the BERy.  It was designed to provide an attractive eastern terminus for the Charles River Basin, hiding the commercial district downstream.</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>NorthPoint</h3>
            <p>The area on your left is now called NorthPoint.  It sits on 42 acres of land, as in not yet complete.</p>
            <p>The first buildings in the development were the pair of towers with the triangular pediments along the roofline.  Those are the Regatta Riverview Residences.  They were designed by TRO Jung Branned Associates, and opened in 1998.</p>
            <p>The building behind and to the left of the Regatta Riverview Residences is Avalon North Point.   It opened in 2008.  It is the most prominent building visiually in North Point after dark.  The top section is enclosed in translucent glass and lit from within at night.</p>
            <p>The North Point Park along the river opened in 2007.  It was designed by Carr, Lynch, and Sandell.  Before NorthPoint, this area was occupied by an industrial park.  A $14 million project cleaned up the "mildly contaminated" soil prior to the construction of the park.</p>
            <p>The office building with the initials "EF" is the US headquarters for the Education First corporation.  It was designed by Sedish architect Gert Wingardh, and opened in 2014.  The dramatic feature zigzagging down the facade is an abstract waterfall.</p>
            <p>The residential tower behind the EF building opened last year.  It was designed by CBT.  It is called the twenty20, because it is a twenty story building located at 20 Child Street.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Footbridge &amp; Skatepark</h3>
            <p>The North Bank Footbridge connects North Point to Charlestown along the bank of the river.  It opened in 2012.  This is a 700 foot long tubular steel truss bridge.  It is called a sinusoidal bridge because the trusses rise over the walkway in some places, and dip below it in others.  The bridge crosses over the railroad tracks and what remains of Millers River.</p>
            <p>The Lynch Family Skatepark is on the downstream side of the EF building.  It opened at the end of last year.  It has 40,000 square feet of smooth concrete space for skateboards, BMX bikes and roller blades.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Railroad Bridges</h3>
            <p>We have to wait for the railroad bridges to open before we can continue downstream.  You'll hear a siren when they start to open.</p>
            <p>These bridges were built for the Boston &amp; Maine railroad, for passenger trains entering and leaving North Station.  They opened in 1931.  Only two of the original four bridges remain.  There are two tracks over each of the bridges..</p>
            <p>These bridges are called rolling lift bridges.  The design was patented by William Scherzer of Chicago in 1893.  Like an ordinary bascule bridge, the 629 ton overhead counterweight balances the weight of the bridge deck.   When the deck goes up, the counterweight goes down.  The center of gravity of the whole structure does not move up or down.</p>
            <p>Unlike an ordinary bascule bridge, these bridges to not pivot on a trunnion.  Instead, they roll back on their heels, moving away from the river as they open.  If you look closely, you can just make out the cleats on the heel that slide into holes in the track on which it rolls.</p>
            <p>The bridges are controlled from the Signal Tower A building on the far side of the tracks.  It one of an extensive network of signal towers in the vast Boston &amp; Maine rail yard that used to stretch a mile from here to Sullivan Square.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Nashua Street</h3>
            <p>The building on the right is the Suffolk County Jail.  It was designed by Stubbins Associations and completed in 1990.</p>
            <p>The Nashua Street Park along the river was designed by Halvorson Design Partnership.  It was created with Big Dig mitigation funds.</p>
            <p>The building downstream from the jail was formerly the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.  Spaulding moved to its new location in Charlestown in 2013.  We'll see that later in the cruise.  This building is now used by Mass General for office and research space.</p>

            <h3>Leverett Connector</h3>
            <p>The next two bridges that we will pass under were part of the Big Dig.  They replaced the double deck Charlestown High Bridge that was built in the 1950's for the old elevated central artery.  This first one is the Leverett Connector, which opened in 1999.  It connects Leverett Circle with I-93 north and U.S. 1 north.</p>
            <p>The Leverett Connector is 830 feet long and 4 lanes wide.  It is a steel box girder bridge.  Its nine box girder sections were barged into place.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Zakim Bridge</h3>
            <p>Next is the Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge.  It is a steel and concrete cable-stayed bridge that was designed by Christian Menn and uel Rosales.  It opened in 2003.</p>
            <p>The bridge is 1432 feet long.  The main deck is 8 lanes wide.  There are two additional lanes cantilevered on the far side of the bridge.  It was the world's widest cable stayed bridge when it opened. </p>
            <p>The bridge has 116 cables in a harp (parallel) design.  The two cantilevered lanes and the slope of the bridge result in an asymmetrical cable pattern supporting the road decks.</p>
            <p>The shape of the bridge is intended to convey a couple historical associations.  The tops of the towers are obelisks, like the Bunker Hill Memorial.  The cables suggest the rigging of the U.S.S. Constitution that we will see in Charlestown.</p>
            <p>As we go under the bridge you will notice patches of light on the river from diamond-shaped cutouts in the roadbed above. These are for the benefit of the Alewife, a species of herring which will not swim into dark patches of water. The cutouts allow sunlight to pass down to the water so that the Alewife will not be deterred from swimming under the bridge to get upriver to spawn.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Paul Revere Park</h3>
            <p>On the left, past the Zakim Bridge, is the Paul Revere Park.  During the Big Dig that space was used as a construction staging zone for the new highway tunnel under City Square.</p>
            <p>The new park opened in 1999,  It too was mitigation for the Big Dig.  It is what Olmstead called a "country park", a planted pastoral oasis.</p>
            <p>There is a pedestrian walkway between Charlestown and Boston here, past the pumping station and over the locks.  If you look closely at its railing on this side of the pumping station, you will see some brightly colored horizontal tubes.  Those the the "Charlestown Bells", an interactive musical sculpture by Paul Matisse.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Gridley Locks &amp; Pumping Station</h3>
            <p>We are coming up on the the new Charles River Dam, which consists of an earthen dam, locks, and a pumping station.  This opened in 1978.  Its purpose was to improve flood control for the Charles River.</p>
            <p>In 1954 and 1955 hurricanes caused flooding on both sides of Charles.  The sluice gates in the old dam could not handle the combination of unusually high volume of water coming down the Charles and storm tides in the harbor.</p>
            <p>The new dam was built by the Army Corps of Engineers.  It got its first test in 1978, after the complex was complete but before it was formally dedicated.  The blizzard of 1978 produced record a high tide 15 feet above mean low water.  The pumps were turned on so that the Charles flowed uphill into the harbor.</p>
            <p>The pumping station contains six pumps, each powered by a 2700hp deisel engine.  Their total capacity is over 3 million gallons per minute.</p>
            <p>The pumping station and locks named for Colonel Richard Gridley, George Washington's chief engineer in the Continental Army.  Gridley engineered the fortifications at the Battle of Bunker Hill in 1775, and at Dorchester Heights.</p>
            <p>We'll go through one of the locks to get to the harbor.  The locks act as elevators for boats, moving them between the water level in the river (grade 8) and the water level in the harbor.  At the moment, the harbor is at low/high tide, so the elevator will be going down/up.  There are mosaic tile height markers near the doors of the locks.</p>

            <h3>Charlestown Bridge</h3>
            <p>After leaving the lock, we'll pass under the Charlestown Bridge.  It was designed by city engineer William Jackson, and opened in 1900.  We'll see three more bridges by Jackson on our cruise.</p>
            <p>This is a steel truss swing span bridge.  A swing bridge opens by rotating its center span 90 degrees, making space on both sides for ships to pass.</p>
            <p>This is a rim-bearing swing bridge.  The pier on which the swing span sits has a circular track on top.  A ring of wheels on the underside of the swing span sit on this track, and roll along the track when the bridge rotates.</p>
            <p>If you look closely at the steel truss superstructure on the swing span, you can see the remains of a second deck.  The entire bridge originally has a second deck for the Boston Elevated Railway.  The elevated tracks were removed in 1975 when the Orange Line subway tunnel opened.  Now the trains go under rather than over the river.</p>
            <p>Trains coming coming to Boston from Charlestown on the elevated tracks came to a fork after passing over the bridge.  The right fork took trains to the tunnel under the center of the city.  The left fork continued as elevated tracks along the waterfront all the way down past South Station.  The two routes rejoined where the tunnel came out in Chinatown.</p>
            <p>This bridge replaced the Charles River Bridge that opened in 1786.  That was the first bridge over the Charles.  It was a draw bridge, not a swing bridge.  Before the Charles River bridge there was a ferry service here.  In 1640 Massachusetts granted the revenue from that ferry to support Harvard College.  The Charles River Bridge was required to pay Harvard &pound;200 annually to make up for the lost revenue.</p>

            <h3>Lovejoy Wharf</h3>
            <p>The two similar brick buildings facing Washington and Causeway streets were both designed by Codman & Despedrelle in the Classical Revivial style.  They opened in 1906 and 1907, and contained light manufacturing.</p>
            <p>The far building facing Causeway Street was renovated in 2004 by Finegold Alexander Architects as commercial and residential space.</p>
            <p>The building facing Washington Street was renovated for Converse by Jennifer Carpenter and complete in 2015.</p>
            <p>Construction is just starting on a new building on Beverly Street next to the two renovated buildings.  It was designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects, and will contain 175 luxury condos.  Unusually, the building will have no on-site parking.</p>
            <p>The public plaza between the Converse building leads to a pedestrian walkway under the Charlestown Bridge.  Thhis is park of Harborwalk.</p>

            <h3>Harborwalk</h3>
            <p>Boston's HarborWalk is a continuous public walkway along the water's edge around Boston Harbor. It is currently about 80% complete. When finished, it will stretch 47 miles along wharves, piers, bridges, beaches and shoreline from Quincy, MA, across the mouth of the harbor to Charlestown and then to East Boston.</p>
            <p>The HarborWalk represents a collaborative effort between city and state agencies, property owners, residents and harbor advocacy groups. We will see numerous glimpses of the HarborWalk on our journey today.</p>

            <h3>Depression &amp; Recovery</h3>
            <p>The Boston shoreline and skyline that we will see today is very different than what you would have seen 50 years ago.  The transformation is related to Boston's economic history.  Unlike the rest of America, Boston did not recover from the Great Depression after WWII.  Here, it continued into the late 1960's.</p>
            <p>The textile and shoe manufacturing industries collapsed after WWII.  Boston lost one quarter of its tax base between 1925 and 1950.  Its population dropped faster than any other American city in 1950's.  In 1959 the city's bond rating was dropped to lowest of any major American city.  Boston had become America's first rust belt city.</p>
            <p>The economic recovery began in the late 1960's and continued through the 1980's.  The shoreline and skyline of central Boston that we will see today were created during that period.  The recovery in South Boston came later, starting in the late 1990's.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Waterfront &amp; Skyline</h3>
            <p>Up through WWII the waterfront was dominated by commercial shipping.  Maritime activity near the cental waterfront also collapsed after WWII.  The wharves fell into disuse.  Some were even converted to parking lots.  Then, during the recovery, they were transformed into the residential and office space you see today.  This was a mixture of new construction and conversion of old buildings.  The conversion of an old building to a new purpose is called <span class="highlight">adaptive reuse</span>.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of the recovery period, the Custom House Tower was still the tallest building in Boston.  It opened in 1915.  Boston was not a skyscraper city.  The Prudential Center opened in 1964.  All of the tall buildings we'll see clustered around the Custom House were constructed during the recovery period, starting in 1969.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Architectural Styles</h3>
            <p>Most of the buildings that we will see from the recovery period are in one of three styles: Modernism, Brutalism or Postmodernism.</p>
            <p>Modernism in the United States came out of skyscrapers.  Picture the Hancock Tower.  The essence of Modernism was Louis Sullivan's famous dictum that "form follows function".  The goal was simplicity and clarity of forms, and elimination of "unnecessary detail".  Modern buildings look very plain compared to the 19th century buildings in Copley Square, both in shape and color.</p>
            <p>Brutalism is one particular form of Modernism, popular in Boston in the 60's and 70's.  Picture Boston City Hall.  The Swiss architect Le Corbusier, who pioneered this style, called it "beton brut" in his native French, which literally means "raw concrete". But English speaking architects call the style Brutalism. Critics of the new City Hall thought that an apt word to describe it.</p>
            <p>Postmodernism was a reaction against Modernism. It was said to herald the return of "wit, ornament and reference" to architecture.  It appears in Boston starting in the 1980's.  Postmodern buildings are more flamboyant in shape and color than the more austere modern buildings.  Postmodern buildings typically include elements from older architectural styles, usually in an abstracted form.  For example, we'll see the Palladian window design from Georgian architecture incorporated into a couple Boston Postmodern buildings.</p>
            <p>More recent buildings that do not fall into any of these three styles are called Contemporary.  That is describing when they were built, not their architectural style, which may not yet even have a name.</p>

            <h3>Coast Guard Station</h3>
            <p>The Coast Guard moved to this location at the end of WWII.  At the time this was known as Constitution Wharf.  That was because the U.S.S. Constitution was built in Hartt's shipyard, which was located here in late 18th century.</p>
            <p>The old brick building was originally the Lowney Chocolate factory.  It was designed by Kendall &amp; Stevens and opened in 1896.  It was renovated for the Coast Guard in 2003.</p>
            <p>The Coast Guard has roots in Massachusetts.  In the 1780's the Massachusetts Humane Society started the first life saving service in the United States.  In 1871 the United States Life Saving Service was created.  In 1915 the USLSS was merged with the Revenue Cutter Service to form the Coast Guard.</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Battery Wharf</h3>
            <p>The pair next pair of buildings in Battery Wharf, a luxury hotel and residential complex.  It was designed by The Architecture Team and opened in 2008.</p>
            <p>Near the street entrance there are tree planters in the shape of boats with wave motifs.  The complex also houses a small museum devoted to Boston's maritime history.</p>
            <p>The name of the wharf comes from the North Battery, an artillery emplacement constructed here in 1646.  Paul Revere started from here, by boat to Charlestown, on April 18, 1775.</p>
            <p>The ship tied up between Battery Wharf and the next wharf is the BFD marine unit.</p>

            <h3>Burroughs Wharf</h3>
            <p>The next development is Burroughs Wharf.  It was designed by Notter, Finegold, Alexander in the Postmodern style, and opened in 1986.</p>
            <p>This two building condo complex includes a public landing, marina slips, and a water taxi stop.</p>
            <p>A century ago, this was the site of a coal pocket for the large brick building coming up next.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Lincoln Wharf</h3>
            <p>It is now called Lincoln Wharf.  It was built in 1907 as a power station for the branch Boston Elevated Railway that ran along the waterfront.  The original building was a windowless cube 150 feet on each side.</p>
            <p>The building was converted to residential in the late 1980's, and is an extreme example of adaptive reuse.  The interior was gutted and 13 floors inserted into the brick shell.  Openings for windows were added.  The architect for the Postmodern renovation was Anderson Notter Associates.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Union Wharf</h3>
            <p>The next development is Union Wharf.  It is composed of two old granite wharf buildings and 23 new townhouses.</p>
            <p>The granite wharf buildings were constructed in the 1830's, for imported shoes.  They were converted to residential in 1979 by Moritz Bergmeyer.</p>

            <h3>Lewis Wharf</h3>
            <p>Now we are passing from the North End to the central waterfront.  Next is Lewis Wharf.  It was designed by Richard Bond and completed in 1840.  It is an early example of the Boston Granite style.  It was once the center of the clipper ship trade in Boston.</p>
            <p>Lewis Wharf was the first of the granite warehouses to be converted to residential.  The renovation was by Carl Koch and Associates, starting in 1965.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Commercial Wharf</h3>
            <p>ext is Commercial Wharf.  It was designed by Isaiah Rogers in the Greek Revival style, and opened in 1834.  The exterior is two-faced, with Quincy granite on the south and Charlestown brick on the north.  Rogers was unsure of how the more expensive granite would hold up in the sea air.</p>
            <p>Commercial Wharf was cut in two by the Atlantic Avenue project which started in 1868 and finished in 1872.  The part on the harbor side was converted to residential in 1969 by Halasz &amp; Halasz in 1969.  The part on the inland side was renovated by Anderson, Notter, Finegold in 1971.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Long Wharf</h3>
            <p>Long Wharf was completed in 1715.  It was 1600 feet long.  At that time the shoreline was on the other side of the Custom House Tower, which sits on made land.  The wharf is shorter now due to landmaking.  The current shoreline was created by the Atlantic Avenue project.  None of the original wharf buildings survive.  There are now three buildings from three centuries on what remains of Long Wharf.  I'll start with the one farthest back from the harbor.</p>
            <p>The Marriott Long Wharf was designed by Cossutta &amp; Associates in the Postmodern style.  It opened in 1982.  The end facing the harbor resembles the prow of a ship.</p>
            <p>The Gardner Building was built circa 1750 in the Georgian style.  It's the only surviving warehouse in Boston from before the American Revolution.  It was renovated by Anderson Notter in the 1970's, and has been the home of the Chart House restaurant ever since.</p>
            <p>The Custom House Block was designed by Isaiah Rogers in the Boston Granite style, and completed in 1847.  The conversion to residential and office space was also done by Anderson Notter in the 1970's.</p>
            <p>Look up State Street as we go past the Custom House Block.  You can see the Old State House.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Central Wharf</h3>
            <p>Central Wharf was completed in 1817.  Like Long Wharf, it is much shorter now due to landmaking.  None of the original wharf buildings survive.  They were demolished when Central Wharf was converted to a parking lot in the postwar era.</p>
            <p>The New England Aquarium opened here in 1969.  This Brutalist building was designed by the Cambridge Seven.  It contains a floor to ceiling 200,00 cylindrical water tank.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Harbor Towers</h3>
            <p>The pair of high-rise residential buildings is called Harbor Towers.  It was designed by Henry Cobb of I.M. Pei Partners, and was completed in 1971.  It's another example of Brutalism.</p>
            <p>Harbor Towers sits on what was originally India Wharf.  The brick warehouses on built on India wharf in 1807 were designed by Charles Bulfinch.</p>
            <p>Harbor Towers raised concerns that the center of Boston might become cut off from the harbor by a wall of high-rises.  The BRA set strict parameters on the design of the next development of the next wharf.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Rowes Wharf</h3>
            <p>The Rowes Wharf complex was completed in 1988.  The Postmodern design was by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill.  It contains a hotel, offices, and condominiums.  The condos are in the two projecting wings.</p>
            <p>The most distinctive feature of Rowes Wharf is the 60 foot double arched entryway, which connects the Kennedy Greenway to the harbor.  Harborwalk winds through Rowes Wharf.</p>

            <p>The bridge across the entrance to the Fort Point Channel is the Northern Avenue Bridge.  This is another rim bearing steel truss swing bridge by William Jackson, similar to the Charlestown Bridge but without the second deck.  This one opened in 1908.</p>
            <p>Its the only bridge over the Fort Point Channel that can still open.  It was closed to automobile traffic in 1997, and used as a pedestrian bridge until an inspection in 2014 found unsafe floor beams.  It has been left in the open position since last December.</p>

            <h3>Moakley Courthouse</h3>
            <p>The John Joseph Moakley U.S. Courthouse was designed by Henry Cobb of Pei, Cobb & Freed, TRO Jung Brannen.  The most distinctive feature of this Postmodern building is the aluminum and glass atrium wall.  It is shaped like a section of an inverted cone, seven stories tall.  There are 735 panes, adding up to an acre of glass. Inside, 27 courtrooms surround the atrium.</p>
            <p>The courthouse sits on part of Fan Pier.  Fan Pier was originally occupied by a railyard.  It also was converted to a parking lot in the postwar years.  Fan pier and the rest of the Seaport District sit on land that was made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>ICA</h3>
            <p>The building with the unusual cantilevered shape is the Institute of Contemporary Art.  It was designed by Diller Scofidio & Renfro.  The ICA moved here from Back Bay in 2006.  The overhang integrates HarborWalk into the building.  The wooden outdoor "bleachers" are reminiscent of a boat house ramp and continue inside to a 325-seat theater.</p>

            <h3>Commonwealth Pier</h3>
            <p>Commonwealth Pier was designed by city engineer Frank Hodgdon and opened in 1901.  It was largest pier building in world at time, handling freight and passenger traffic.  It had rail and truck connections onto the pier.</p>
            <p>Commonwealth Pier was made obsolete by containerized shipping in the 1970's.  In 1986 it was renovated by Jung/Brannen Associates, creating an 800,000 square-foot facility for exhibition space and offices for high-tech and international trade companies.  At that time it was renamed the World Trade Center.</p>

        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Seaport District</h3>
            <p>The transformation of the South Boston waterfront did not get started until the 1990's.  The BRA created a plan to redevelop this part of South Boston, which it christened the Seaport District.  Four public projects in addition to the Moakley Courthouse laid the foundation for the building boom you see today.</p>
            <p>The plan called for a new main thoroughfare named Seaport Boulevard.  It was connected to central Boston by the Evely Moakley Bridge in 1996.  The Ted Williams Tunnel opened in 1995, providing convenient automobile connections to Logan Airport and the Mass Pike.  The MBTA Silver Line started service to the Seaport District in 2004, providing public transportation to the airport and South Station.</p>
            <p>The Boston Convention and Exhibition Center also opened in 2004.  It draws hundreds of thousand of attendees annually to the Seaport District.  You can no longer see it from the harbor because of the many tall buildings that have been springing up like weeds here in the last 10 years.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Landmaking &amp; Railyards</h3>
            <p>The entire Seaport District sits on land that was made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  The made land starts at the Fort Point Channel and goes all the way out to Castle Island.  It extends all the way back to 2nd Street, about a mile south of the shoreline we passed.  It adds up to 1012 acres of made land.</p>
            <p>Much of the land was originally occupied by rail yards.  Fan Pier got its name from the radial layout of the tracks for the Boston &amp; Albany rail yard, which resembled the ribs of a hand held fan.</p>
            <p>Fan Pier and the other rail yards in the Seaport District were removed and replaced by parking lots in the post WWII era.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Passengers &amp; Freight Today</h3>
            <p>Passenger and freight ships still come to South Boston, but no longer to the Seaport District.  The real seaport in South Boston is now along the reserve channel, farther east and south of here.</p>
            <p>If you look back past Fish Pier you can see the blue gantry cranes of Conley Terminal on far side of the Reserve Channel.  It handles container ships.  In start contrast to Commonwealth Pier, there is no rail connection to Conley Terminal.  Everything goes in and out by truck.</p>
            <p>MassPort operates a passenger ship terminal on the near side of the Reserve Channel, known as the Black Falcon terminal.  It handles cruise ships.</p>

            <p>Look to the left at the cluster of tall buildings around the Custom House Tower.  The Custom House Tower is the one with a clock on each side, currently encased in scaffolding above the clocks.</p>
            <p>The 495 foot tower that you see was added in 1915.  It was designed by Peabody &amp; Stearns in the Classical Revival style.</p>
            <p>The original Custom House was designed by Ammi Young in the Greek Revival style, and completed in 1847.  It was a two story building with a dome in the center.  The dome is still there, encased in the lower floors of the tower.  The mezzanine around the dome is open to the public, and contains a historical display on Boston's maritime history.</p>
            <p>The Custom House Tower remained the tallest building in central Boston until 1969, early in the recover period.</p>

            <p>75 State Street was designed by Graham Gund in collaboration with Skidmore, Owings & Merrill.  It opened in 1988.</p>
            <p>The exterior is red and pink granite.  It has gold chevrons reminiscent of the Art Deco style.</p>

            <h3>International Place</h3>
            <p>Now look to the left, past Harbor Towers, until you see a cylindical building with a cone on top.  It is part of the three building Internation Place complex.</p>
            <p>International Place was designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee.  It opened in 1992 and is another Postmodern building.  Note the faux Palladian windows, a reference to the Georgian architecture of 18th century Boston.</p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>We are now crossing the shipping channel to the north side of the harbor, now occupied by East Boston.  In colonial times there was no East Boston.  There were five islands surrounded by tidal mud flats.  Farmers used the islands to raise hay and graze livestock.</p>
            <p>In 1833, William Sumner acquired the rights to the islands and formed the East Boston Company to develop it as a residential and industrial area. East Boston expanded rapidly with shipbuilding and related industries.  In 1833 the population was only eight.  By 1855 it was over 15,000.</p>
            <p>The company laid out grids of straight and wide streets over Noddles Island, and commenced landmaking operations.  Eventually, 354 acres of made land were added to this part of East Boston.</p>
            <p>From the 1840's through the 1860's, clipper ships were built at Donald McKay's ship yard in East Boston.</p>
            <p>The Cunard line started transatlantic service to their pier in East Boston in 1840.  It became an entry and destination point for the many immigrant groups arriving in Boston and was known as "The Ellis Island of New England."</p>
            <p>Two ferries, called "Penny Ferries," connected East Boston to Boston in the 1850s. In 1904 a trolley subway, now the Blue Line, was built under the harbor.</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Logan Airport</h3>
            <p>Logan Airport is a 20th century addition to East Boston.  It opened in 1923 on 134 acres of made land.  Today it occupies 1413 acres of land, most of which was made during the 1940's.</p>
            <p>Logan Airport is one reason that Boston does not have any really tall buildings like Chicago or New York.  The FAA placed height restrictions on buildings in the aircraft approach paths to Logan.</p>
            <p>Find the Hyatt Hotel, and look to the left for a building with 4 towers on top.  That is ventilation builidng #7, part of the Big Dig.  Huge fans below it pull fresh air into the Ted Williams Tunnel and push exhaust air out.</p>

            <h3>Nantucket Lightship LV-112</h3>
            <p>The ship with the name Nantucket painted on its hull in the Nantucket lightship.  A lightship is a floating lighthouse.  Between 1820 and 1952, 179 lightships were built in North America.</p>
            <p>This one was built in 1936 and  was the largest U.S. lightship ever built.  It served for 39 years on the Nantucket Shoals station, guiding ocean going vessels through the dangerously shallow waters.</p>
            <p>The ship was originally steam powered.  It was converted to diesel power in 1960.</p>
            <p>The ship was decommissioned in 1975, and moved here in 2010.  It is open to the public on Saturdays.  On August 7th it will celebrate National Lighthouse Day by activating its beacon and foghorn.</p>

            <h3>Piers Park</h3>
            <p>To the left of the airport, look for a pier with a round pavilion at the end.  That is Piers Park.  It was created by MassPort and opened in 1995.</p>
            <p>Piers Park has a children's playground on its street side, and a 600 foot promenade out the pier.  Halfway out, there is a historical display about Donald McKay and the clipper ships.</p>
            <p>The end of the pier, where the pavilion is, has great views of central Boston and the Seaport District.  It's one of Boston's hidden gems.</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>New Street</h3>
            <p>The construction boom we saw in the Seaport District, the North End, and NorthPoint is conspicuously absent here.  That lone high-rise is the 16 story New Street apartment complex, due to be completed this year.  It's the tallest building in East Boston.</p>

            <h3>Charlestown Navy Yard</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>In 1800 the U.S. Navy created six yards to construct and repair naval vessels.  One of them was here in Charlestown.  By the time it closed in 1974 about 200 ships had been built here and thousands repaired.  During WWII, almost 50,000 people were employed in the Navy Yard.</p>
            <p>The original site plan was created by Loammi Baldwin, who was also the engineer for the Middlesex Canal.  In 1833 he designed the first naval dry dock in New England.  It is still in use today, currently occupied by the U.S.S. Constitution..</p>
            <p>After the naval yard closed, 30 acres became part of Boston National Historical Park.  The remaining 105 acres were transferred to the BRA in 1978.</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Spaulding Rehabilitation Facility</h3>
            <p>The building on the far right of the former navy yard is the new Spaulding Rehabilitation Facility.  Spaulding morve here from Nahua Street in 2013.</p>
            <p>This Contemporary building was designed by Perkins+Will.  It is engineered to be fully functional even if the entire first floor is submerged.</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Flagship Wharf</h3>
            <p>The large condo complex to the left of Spaulding is Flagship Wharf.  It is a Postmodern design by The Architects Collaborative.  It opened in 1990.</p>
            <p>This complex is a mixture of adaptive reuse and new construction.  The renovated a building that housed electrical and weapons systems shops, and added two new wings.</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Old Ironsides</h3>
            <p>The U.S.S. Constitution is in the national park space to the left.  It was build in 1797 at Hartt's Shipyard in the North End, where the Coast Guard station is today.</p>
            <p>The Constitutions hull is 24 inches thick at some points.  It earned the nickname Old Ironsides in a legendary battle with the frigate HMS Guerriere during the War of 1812.  British cannon balls seemed to rebound harmlessly off Constitution’s thick hull of live oak.  A sailor cried out, “Huzzah, her sides are made of iron!”</p>
            <p>The Constitutions mainmast is 220 feet tall.  Normally you would see it with its rigging.  But the ship is currently in dry dock for overhaul.  Its rigging and armament have been temporarily removed.  But if you go there, you can see the copper sheething on her hull, which is rormallly below water.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Constitution Marina</h3>
            <p>Looking to the left of the old navy yard, next is Constitution Marina.  It is the largest port for boaters in Boston.  More than 100 people, some with their families, live here year-round on their boats.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Bunker Hill Monument</h3>
            <p>Behind Constitution Marina you can see the Bunker Hill Monument.  It marks teh site of the Battle of Bunker Hill which took place on June 17, 1775.  It replaced an earlier monument in the form of a Tuscan column that was installed in 1794.</p>
            <p>This monument was designed by Solomon Willard.  The cornerstone was laid on June 17, 1825, the 50th anniversary of the battle.  But the monument was not completed until 1843 because of difficulty in raising funds</p>
            <p>This was the first obelisk-shaped monument in the United States and was completed before the more famous Washington Monument.</p>
            <p>Look ahead at the Zakim Bridge.  Its towers are also in the shape of obelisks.  Do the cables remind you of a sail ship?</p>
            <p>During the battle, English General Howe ordered the town of Charlestown burned. There are no buildings built prior to the Revolutionary War remaining in Charlestown.</p>
            <p>During the battle, the American commander, Colonel Prescott, gave the famous order "don’t fire till you see the whites of their eyes".</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Tudor Wharf</h3>
            <p>To the left of Constitution Marina there is a Marriott Residence Inn.  It occupies what was once the wharf of Frederic Tudor, known as "The Ice King.  Tudor developed techniques that allowed him to ship blocks of ice to warm climates and made ice a major New England export.</p>
            <p>His first shipment of ice left from here in 1806, bound for Martinique.  By the mid-19th century, tons of ice cut from local ponds were shipped to Latin America, India and even the Far East.</p>

            <h3>Landmaking</h3>
            <p>The area in on your right in Cambridge is called the Lechmare Triangle.  It is made land, created as part of the Cambridge Embankment.</p>
            <p>The Lechmere Canal was made not by digging, but by leaving a channel through the made land.  It used to be longer, turning left and running parallel to First Street, through what is now the Cambridgeside Galleria.</p>
            <p>In Charles Elliott's 1894 plan, this was a park called "The Front".  That park was never built.  In 1950 Cambridge sold the land to devlopers who built the Sonesta Hotel and industrial buildings.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>1978 Riverfront Plan</h3>
            <p>In 1978 the city adopted the <em class="highlight">East Cambridge Riverfront Plan</em> to redevelop the Lechmere Triangle.  Its primary author was  urban planner Dennis Carlone.</p>
            <p>The main artery was moved from the parkway alog the river back to Land Boulevard.  The parkway was reduced from 5 lanes to a one way access road, and the land freed up converted to green space.</p>
            <p>The industrial buildings were replaced by the residential and office buildings you see today.  The Sonesta Hotel stayed.</p>
            <p>Part of the Lechmere Canal was filled, and the Cambridgeside Galleria built on the made land.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Sonesta Hotel West Wing</h3>
            <p>The west wing of the Sonesta Hotel was added in 1984.  It was designed by John Olson in the Postmodern style.  It has green triangular pediments, some with half moon lunette windows.</p>
            <p>The wall on the left is not flat.  The windows are set at angles to give every room a river view.</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Riverside Place</h3>
            <p>The next buiding upstream is Riverside Place.  It is a Modern design by Hugh Stubbins &amp; Associates that opened in 1984.</p>
            <p>Stubbins is best know for its skyscrapers.  This low-rise with strong horizontal lines shows a different side of their work.</p>

            <h3>Esplanade Condominiums</h3>
            <p>The next building is the Esplanade Condominiums.  The luxury condominium complex was designed by Moshe Safdie in the Postmodern style and opened in 1989.</p>
            <p>Its terraced facade of white precast concrete panels is reminiscent of his Habitat 67 design for the Montreal world expo.</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Rowland Institute</h3>
            <p>The next building is the Rowland Institute.  With its brick construction and horizontal lines, it looks a lot like Riverside Place.  Not surprising, since it was also designed by Hugh Stubbins & Associates.  It opened in 1981.</p>
            <p>Rowland Institute at Harvard was originally founded by the late Edwin H. Land, founder of the Polaroid, after whom Land Boulevard is named.</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Athenaeum Press</h3>
            <p>Back behind the point of the Lechmre Triangle you can see an older building with a statue of Athena on its cornice.  That was originally the Athenaeum Press building.  It was designed by Lockwood, Greene &amp; Co. in the Classical Revival style, and opened in 1895.</p>
            <p>The building originally housed printing operations.  It was renovated in 2005.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Power Plant</h3>
            <p>The yellow brick building is a power plant, originally built for the Cambridge Electric Light Co. in 1949.  It was designed by Gilbert Associates, and is a late, streamlined example of the Art Deco style.</p>
            <p>This was the last industrial user of the Charles River, receiving its fuel oil by barge until 1986.</p>
            <p>It is now operated by the French energy company Veolia, and called the Kendall Cogeneratoin Station.  Congeneration means that it produces electricity and steam.  Some of that steam is sent to Boston via pipes over the Longfellow Bridge and the Lechmere Viaduct.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Broad Canal</h3>
            <p>The Broad Canal is on the upstream side of the power plant.  It was dug in 1806-10 from the low water mark to Portland Street, and on alongside Portland Street.  The canal was extended as landmaking move the shoreline out.</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Longfellow Bridge</h3>
            <p>This bridge opened in 1906.  It was originally called the Cambridge Bridge.  In 1927 it was renamed in honor of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.</p>
            <p>The bridge was designed by William Jackson and Boston city architect Edmund March Wheelwright.  It is a steel ribbed arch bridge.  It was the first bridge over the Charles that did not open.  Instead it has arches to provide the clearance required by War Department</p>
            <p>This bridge is 1767 feet long, less that half the length of its predecessor.  That is because landmaking had made made the river narrower.</p>
            <p>The piers for the middle span are shaped like the prows of Viking ships near the waterline.  This was based on the legend that Lief Eriksson had come to North America centuries before Columbus.</p>
            <p>prows of Viking ships on the piers below the towers based on Leif Eriksson legend</p>
            <p>The piers have the seals of Boston and Cambridge above the prows.</p>
            <p>This is sometimes called the &quot;salt and pepper bridge&quot; because of the appearance of the towers.  But not today, because the towers have been temporarily removed.</p>

            <p>One man was responsible for the transformation of the Cambridge bank of the Charles along here.  Charles Davenport made his fortune in the 1840's manufacturing omnibuses and railroad passenger cars.</p>
            <p>He became a founder of the Grand Junction Railroad, which built tracks from Brookline through Cambridge and Somerville in the 1850's.  The track was mostly on a high embankment.  It straightened out the shoreline.</p>
            <p>He later founded the Charles River Embankment Company, which purchased the flats between the West Boston and Cottage Farm bridges.  In 1882 the company reached an agreement with Cambridge to make land.  It began constructing a seawall and filling behind it.</p>
            <p>The plan was to create a residential district, the Cambridge version of Boston's Back Bay.  But this did not work out, and the company went bankrupt in 1893.  The made land was deeded to Cambridge.</p>
            <p>The made land remained almost entirely empty.  They did build the Charles River Road along the shoreline, which was renamed Memorial Drive in 1923 for WWI dead.</p>

            <p>The school started looking for space for a larger campus in the late 1800's.  In 1912 they purchased the Charles River Embankment land east of the Harvard Bridge.  In 1916 MIT moved to its new campus in Cambridge, with elaborate ceremonies.</p>

            <p>This Brutalist building was designed by I.M. Pei and opened in 1964.  It houses the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Science.</p>

            <p>The original 1916 campus is coming up.  Its centerpiece was the Great Dome, which was inspired by the Pantheon in Rome.</p>
            <p>The 1916 campus was designed by William Bosworth in the Classical Revival style.  It was unusual in that all of the buildings were interconnected.  This was intended to discourage departmental boundaries.</p>
            <p>The campus was oriented towards the river, around the Great Court.  The main entrance and on Massachusetts Avenue with the spacious lobby was not added until 1939.  The campus is now oriented east-west, along what they call the "infinite corridor".</p>

            <p>It was designed by Henry B. Ball &amp; H.E. Davidson in the Tudor Revival style.  MIT purchased it in 1937 and converted it to student housing.  It is now called Maseeh Hall.</p>

            <p>This is a haunched girder bridge, 2164 feet long.  It originally had a swing span in the center.  That was replace by a fixed span when the bridge was overhauled in 1924.  It had another major overhaul in the late 1980's.</p>
            <p>In 1958 members of a fraternity measured the length of the bridge using one of their own, Oliver Smoot, as a ruler.  It's 364.4 Smoots long.  There are distance markers on the bridge every 10 smoots.</p>

            <p>The transformation of the Back Bay started with the Mill Dam in 1821.  Today's Beacon Street started as a toll road atop the dam.  The Mill Dam was a technical success, but a financial and ecological failure.  It created a stagnant basin where raw sewage collected, isolated from the flow of the river.</p>
            <p>The Back Bay project started in the 1850's and finished in the 1880's.  It filled the basin behind the dam, replacing a public nuisance with valuable land.  A strip of land was also made for a row of houses on this side of Beacon Street.</p>
            <p>The 1910 Boston Embankment added a 100 foot wide strip of land behind those homes here, and a 300 foot wide strip downstream past the bend near Berkley Street.  It was bare, without trees or benches.  The seawall made the water choppy and unattractive to boaters.</p>
            <p>In 1936 the embankment was widened to form the Storrow Memorial Embankment.  The new park was designed by Arthur Shurcliff.  It included a sloped shoreline, the central lagoon, the curved islands around Community Boating, and a music lawn.  Some years after it opened, people started calling the Embankment the Esplanade.</p>
            <p>Arthur Fiedler directed his first outdoor concert in 1929, from a temporary structure..  The Hatch Shell opened in 1940.</p>
            <p>The new embankment was made possible by a $1M donation from the widow of James Jackson Storrow.  It was made on the condition that there not be a highway through the park.</p>
            <p>But after WWII traffic considerations won out.  Storrow Drive opened in 1951, and soon expanded.  22 acres of land was made to compensate for the land lost to the road.  But Mrs. Storrow's donation was not returned.  Instead, to add insult to injury, the raod was named after her late husband.</p>

            <h3>High Spine</h3>
            <p>In 1959 the BAS formed the Committee on Civic Design.  In 1960 Kevin Lynch contributed a sketch for what he called the "high spine".  That was a two block wide corridor of tall building from Back Bay through financial district and Fort Point Channel.  We are cruising parallel to it.</p>

            <h3>Prudential Center and Tower</h3>
            <p>The Prudential Tower was completed in 1964.  It is a Modern design by Charles Luckman.  The building is more significant for its "firsts" than for its design.</p>
            <p>This was the first "vertebrae" in the high spine.  It the talles building outside New York at the time, making it the first new building in Boston that was particulary tall by the standards of its time since the Ames Building in 1893, which was the talles building on the east coast when it opened.</p>
            <p>It was an one of the first highly visible sign of the beginning of Boston's recovery from its depression.  The city had convinced and large national company to build a new regional headquarters in Boston.</p>

            <h3>Hancock Tower</h3>
            <p>The Hancock Tower in Copley Square was designed by Henry Cobb of I.M. Pei and opened in 1975.  It is considered to be an achievement in minimalist, modernist skyscraper design</p>
            <p>Construction was plagued by a series of problems.  The excavation of its foundation undermined neighboring Trinity Church.  The original glass windows tended to break and pop up.  The upper floors swayed in the wind, making office workers sea sick.</p>
            <p>To appreciate the Hancock Tower you need to stand in Copley Square, facing Trinity Church.  The 60 story building next to the church manages to not be the center of attention.</p>
            <p>Its rhomboid shape with presents facade facing Trinity Church.  Its windows reflect the surroundings.</p>
            <p>Last month an art installation appeared on the west side of the building.  It was later revealed that the image was by the French photographer and artist who goes by JR.  It’s made from perforated vinyl imprinted with a magnified photograph he took on his travel.</p>

            <p>The hotel is next to the Massachusetts General Hospital, whose campus now consists of 25 buildings and 3 parking garages.</p>
            <p>Mass General was founded in 1811.  In 1821 it moved into its first building here, a Classical Revival design by Charles Bulfinch.  The building is still there, surrounded by newer larger ones.</p>
            <p>The Bulfinch building has a dome on top.  In 1846 the first surgery using ether as an anesthetic took place there.  It is now called the "Ether Dome", and there a historical exhibit open to the public there.</p>

            <h3>West End</h3>
            <p>Mass General is surrounded by the West End.  This used to be a beloved working class neighborhood of 10,000 residents representing 43 nationalities.</p>
            <p>Starting in 1958, an urban renewal project evicted the residents and demolished their homes.  Only a historic buildings were spared (Old West Church, first Harrison Gray Otis house).</p>
            <p>The old neighborhood was replaced by Charles River Park, with its high-rise luxury apartment buildings.  These were designed by Victor Gruen in the Modern style.  He was best known for his work on suburban shopping malls.</p>
            <p>Ever since, this has been considered a case study in how not to do urban renewal.</p>

            <h3>Charlesbank</h3>
            <p>The first section of the Charles River Basin to be converted to park space was the Boston shoreline between the Longfellow Bridge and the old dam.  Charlesbank was designed by Frederick Law Olmstead and opened in 1892.  It was the first free  outdoor recreational facility in the United States.</p>
            <p>Charlesbank had a track and outdoor gymnasium for men and boys at the downstream end, and a track and playground for women and girls at upstream end.  In between was a greensward with paths, benches and lights</p>
            <p>Storrow Drive and Charles Street now run where Charlesbank was.  All that remains is a portion of seawall and a wading pool.  The land now occupied by the Teddy Ebersol fields was made to compensate.</p>

            <p>Welcome to the Fort Point Channel tour.  We will be talking about the channel, the land and buildings alongside it, and the bridges over it.  Today's tour will last 90 minutes, and we will walk a little over a mile.  The tour will end at Rolling Bridge Park where Dorchester Avenue crosses the channel.</p>
            <p>Boston By Foot is a non-profit educational organization.  It was founded in 1976, to promote public awareness of Boston's historical and architectural heritage.  We offer a variety of tours of Boston, which are described in the brochure that I gave you (wave it).  Boston By Foot has around two hundred volunteer tour guides.</p>

            <h3>Haunched Girder</h3>
            <p>
                The load is transferred from the girders directly to the supporting piers.
                A haunched girder is deeper at the piers and shallower mid-span typically following a parabolic curve.
                  Haunching increases the stiffness at mid-span to a a graceful aesthetic not found in thicker boxy girder bridges.
            </p>
            <p>
                The concrete is pre-stressed using pretensioned tendons.
                Tendons are steel cables pulled tight to form a straight line under high tension.
                Concrete is then cast around the tendons.  The tension on the tendons is released after the concrete hardens.
                The friction against the concrete prevents the tendons from moving, so the compression force is transferred from the tendons to the concrete.
                This puts the concrete itself under compression, giving it added strength.

            <p>
                The bridge was designed with an above-water utility crossing in mind.  There are various pipes under the bridge.
                Some provide drainage from the roadway and others are rented space for utilities to connect South Boston and downtown.

            <p>Strauss used concrete for the counterweight instead of iron, thus reducing costs.
                To allow the great weights to move, he developed the mUltiple trunnion, or pin-connected
                counterweight, which allowed the counterweight to pivot as it moved, and obviated the need for
                a pit to receive the counterweight when the leaf was upright. </p>
            <p>ornamented by the noted Boston architects, Desmond and Lord ... The cut-stone piers

        <p>Welcome to this Boston By Foot tour, Reinventing Boston.  We will be talking about projects that have changed the face of Boston over the centuries.  Today's tour will last 90 minutes, and we will walk about 1.5 miles.  The tour will end at the end of Long Wharf.</p>
        <p>Boston By Foot is a non-profit educational organization.  It was founded in 1976, to promote public awareness of Boston's historical and architectural heritage.  We offer a variety of tours of Boston, which are described in the brochure that I gave you (wave it).  Boston By Foot has around two hundred volunteer tour guides.</p>

            <h3>Center of Boston</h3>
            <p>In Colonial times, this intersection was the center of Boston.  Back then there two ways to travel to and from Boston: by land and by sea.  Washington Street was the land route, taking you to the narrow strip of land, called the neck, that connected the Shawmut peninsula to the mainland.  State Street was the sea route, taking you down to Long Wharf where you would board a ship.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Long Wharf</h3>
            <p>Long Wharf was one of the early projects that changed the face of Boston.  Construction started in 1711.  When it was completed in 1715, Long Wharf was 1600 feet long.  It's end was in deep water, so ocean-going vessels could tie up directly.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Bonner Map</h3>
            <p>Look at this map of Boston from 1722.  You can see how Long Wharf dominated the waterfront.  We are standing here, at the intersection of what were then called Cornhill and King Streets.  You can see the Old State House, across the street there, on this map.  Before Long Wharf, the main facility for loading and unloading ships was the Town Dock, over here.  Note this other cove on the north side of the peninsula, and the Mill Creek connecting it to the waterfront.  We will talk about that later in the tour.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Old State House</h3>
            <p>Standing here, we are surrounded by three centuries of Boston architecture: (pointing) the 18th century, the 19th century, and the 20th century.  The Old State House was built 1712-12, in the Georgian style.  It was the seat of Colonial Government.  From its front side, you can see all the way to the end of Long Wharf.  We'll see the Old State House from Long Wharf at the end of the tour.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Ames Building</h3>
            <p>That (pointing) is the Ames Building.  It was built in 1889-93.  If you have seen Trinity Church in Copley Square, you may see some similarities.  Trinity Church was designed by H.H. Richardson, who died in 1886.  His  practice was taken over by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge, who designed the Ames Building.  The style is called Richardsonian Romanesque.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Skyscraper?</h3>
            <p>The Ames Building is 13 stories and 188 feet tall, and was the tallest building on the east coast when it opened.  It straddles the beginning of the skyscraper era.  Two technical innovations made skyscrapers possible: steel framework and the elevator.  The Ames Building had elevators, but not a steel framework.  It is held up by its load bearing walls.  To support the weight of the building, the wall are 9 feet thick at the base.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Height Restriction</h3>
            <p>This building was one of the reasons that the state passed a law in 1891 restricting the height of future buildings to 125 feet. The Ames building remained the tallest building in Boston until 1928 when the height restriction was relaxed, with one exception.  The federal government added a 30 story tower to the Custom House in 1913-15.  As a federal building, it was exempt from the local law.  Boston sat out the skyscraper era.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>28 State Street</h3>
            <p>The Custom House tower was the tallest building in the central business district until 1969, the New England Merchant Bank opened.  It was designed by Edward Barnes in the modern style of the 50's and 60's.  As you can see, it is very plain compared to the Ames building.  This building is supported by a steel framework.  The exterior is what's called a "curtain wall".  It hangs off the steel framework.  You could remove the exterior wall of a middle story and it would have no effect on the floors above.  If you did that to the Ames building, the floors above woulld collapse.  This building, now known as 28 State Street, was part of the Government Center project.  We'll be talking about that at our next stop.</p>

    </div>
    <div data-role="content">
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Scollay Square</h3>
            <p>This is Government Center.  It was developed in the 1960's.  Before then, this area, like the one we just came from, was filled with narrow, winding streets and buildings from many periods packed close together.  That sign (pointing) marks the location of Scollay Square.  In 1960 it was a run down entertainment district.  My uncles who served at sea during WWII had fond memories of Scollay Square.  A sailor could have a good time on shore leave there.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>New Boston</h3>
            <p>By the middle of the 20th century Boston had been in a period of stagnation for decades.  In 1954, then mayor John Hynes began to promote his vision for revitalizing the city, which he called the "New Boston".  His successor, John Collins, followed through on that vision.  This was the age of urban renewal.  Scollay Square was selected as the site for a group of new government buildings.  It was declared a blighted district, and funding was obtained from the federal government for the project.  I.M. Pei, who was not yet a famous architect, was hired to create the master plan for the complex.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Superblock</h3>
            <p>This is an example of what was called an urban renewal "superblock".  City Hall Plaza is surrounded by large, widely space buildings that form a boundary between that open space and neighboring areas of the city.  The plaza is covered by over 2.5 million bricks, meant to provide continuity with traditional Boston.  The Sears Crescent was preserved as the south boundary of the plaza.  The Center Plaza buildings echo its curve.  Note the combination of old and new building materials: brick and concrete.  The vertical and horizontal towers on the far side of the plaza are the JFK federal building, designed by The Architects Collaborative.  28 State Street was also part of the Government Center project.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Brutalist</h3>
            <p>But the centerpiece of Government Center is Boston City Hall. Kallman, McKinnell and Knowles won the design competition for the building.  The exterior is mostly unfinished concrete.  The Swiss architect Le Corbusier, who pioneered this style, called it "beton brut", which literally means "raw concrete".  But English speaking architects call the style Brutalism.  Critics of the building thought that an apt word to describe it.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Form Follows Function</h3>
            <p>The exterior reflects the interior structure, and is an example of the architectural dictum that "form follows function".  The base, covered in brick and continuous with the plaza, holds a concourse for departments that have a great deal of public contact.  The top floors, behind the concrete cornice of beehive-like window openings, contain bureaucratic offices.  The large shapes in between are the exterior walls of the mayor's office, city council chamber, and city councilor offices.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Three Projects</h3>
            <p>Government Center was one of three large projects that were transforming Boston at this time.  The others were the West End and the Prudential Center.  Together they were successful in changing attitudes toward the city.  It felt like Boston was becoming a modern city.  But all three were criticized for creating islands in the city that did not relate well to their surroundings.</p>

        <a href="#qm">Next</a>
    </div>
    <div data-role="content">
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Adams Square</h3>
            <p>This part of Boston City Hall sits on what was previously Adams Square.  The statue of Samuel Adams over there in front of Faneuil Hall stood in the middle of Adams Square.  It was moved to its current location when Adams Square was razed and Congress Street was extended to run along the east side of Government Center.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Three Phases of the T</h3>
            <p>The changes made for Government Center extended underground to the subway.  Boston had the first subway system in America.  It opened in 1897, and was the first phase of Boston's new mass transit system.  It ran from North Station to the Public Garden, with stops here at Adams Square and at Scollay Square.  The second phase was an elevated railway from Sullivan Square in Charlestown to Dudley Square in Roxbury, which opened in 1901.  It included the Atlantic Avenue Loop along the waterfront, which connected North and South Stations.  The third phase was a subway tunnel under Boston Harbor to East Boston, which opened in 1904.  On this side of the harbor, the tunnel started at a station under the Atlantic Avenue elevated at State Street.  This line ended at the Court Street station, near the Old State House.   The Adams, Scollay, and Court stations are now gone, replaced by the Government Center Station.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>T Color Codes</h3>
            <p>The current color-coding of the T's subway lines dates from 1967.  The Green Line gets that color because it runs along the Common and Public Garden.  The Orange Line ran along Washington Street, which was named Orange Street in colonial times.  The blue line runs under the harbor.  The Red Line used to end at Harvard.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Town Dock</h3>
            <p>Remember the Town Dock from the 1722 map we saw?  It was right there, where the statue of Samuel Adams, and Faneuil Hall are today.  They sit on made land.  The Town Dock was an inlet that was square off and enclosed in the 1600's, with a swing bridge across its mouth.  At that time, the work dock meant the water that a ship sits in when tied up, not the structure to which it is tied.   The area became known as Dock Square. </p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Faneuil Hall</h3>
            <p>The south side of the Town Dock was filled during 1728-29 to make space for shops and a public market.  In 1740 merchant Peter Faneuil offered to build a new marketplace at his own expense on the recently made land.  The building was designed by John Smibert, and constructed in 1741-42.  The building you see today is much larger than the original.  Faneuil Hall was enlarged in 1805-06.  Charles Bulfinch was the architect.  The building was widened from 3 to 7 windows bays, the third story was added, and the first floor, which had been an open market, was enclosed.  The right side is the original part of the building.</p>

    </div>
    <div data-role="content">
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Quincy Market</h3>
            <p>By the early 19th century, the market area around Faneuil Hall had become overcrowded, and the Town Dock no longer served its original purpose.  The city's main sewer line emptied into it.  The stagnant water was a receptacle for rubbish and dead animals.  Then mayor Josiah Quincy III decided to make a new marketplace the centerpiece of his administration.  The Town Dock was filled in, and a new sea wall built at the far end of the made land.  Existing buildings were torn down and six new streets were created.  The central market building and the two flanking warehouses were built in 1724-25.  They were designed by Alexander Parris in the Greek Revival style.  The central market building is 535 feet long and 50 feet wide, with a central dome.  It is made of granite, and each of the columns on that portico is a single piece of granite.  We'll see the matching portico at the other end of the building later in the tour.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Pilings</h3>
            <p>How does made land support large buildings like this?  Why don't they sink?  The answer is pilings, tree trunks whose bark has been stripped off.  These are driven down as far as possible, and then cut off below groundwater.  The stone foundation rests on them.  Pilings are fine as long as they remain under water.  But if the groundwater level drops, they are exposed to air and rot, undermining the building that sits on them.  This has happened many times in Boston, especially in the Back Bay.  In 1986 the city established the Boston Groundwater Trust to monitor groundwater levels.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Renovation</h3>
            <p>By the 1950's these buildings had deteriorated to the point where they were slated for demolition, like Scollay Square and the West End.  But in 1966 the BRA commissioned a preservation and modernization report that lead to a two million dollar federal grant to restore the buildings.  But the project did not start until Mayor Kevin White selected the team of architect Ben Thompson and developer James Rouse in 1973.  The restored market opened in 1976, and became a model for "festival marketplaces" around the country.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Urban Renewal Superblock</h3>
            <p>Now think about this area in comparison to Government Center.  Both were large projects that transformed a part of the city.  In both cases, buildings were torn down and the street plan changed.  The new buildings that went up were on a different scale and in a different style than their older neighbors.  The buildings create a boundary between the central space and the surrounding city.  So you can think of Quincy Market as the urban renewal superblock of the 1820's.</p>

    </div>
    <div data-role="content">
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Mill Creek &amp; Pond</h3>
            <p>North Street here follows the original harbor shoreline.  Remember the other cove from the map we saw at our first stop, the one separating the North End from the West End?  It was just a couple blocks up Blackstone Street there.  Where we are standing was one end of the first large engineering project to change the face of Boston.  In 1643 the town granted that entire cove to a group of businessmen on the condition that they build and maintain gristmills.  These mills were powered by the tide.  The mouth of the cove was dammed, and a millstream dug from the cove to here along what is now Blackstone Street.  The cove and stream became known as the Mill Pond and Mill Creek.  We will talk more about the Mill Pond at our next stop.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Bridges &amp; Dock</h3>
            <p>The Mill Creek turned the North End into an island.  Traffic to and from the North End had to cross the Mill Creek at one of two drawbridges, one here and the other at Hanover Street.  The drawbridge here allowed ships to use the Mill Creek as a passage to Scottow's Dock, which was located behind the current hotel.  It was filled in the late 18th century, and for a time completely forgotten.  It was rediscovered by an archaeological investigation in 1981, when this hotel was being constructed.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>19th Century</h3>
            <p>The Mill Creek remained open even after the mills closed.  In the early 19th century, it carried barge traffic between the harbor and the end of the Middlesex Canal, across the Charles in Cambridge.  By the time the Faneuil Hall Marketplace was being planned, the shoreline had moved outward and the Mill Creek extended along with it.  Its mouth was where the east side of the North Market building now sits.  In 1824 this end of the Mill Creek was turned, making space for the North Market building.  This end of the Mill Creek was filled in 1828.</p>

            <h3>Overlaid Maps</h3>
            <p>Here is a current map of Boston overlaid with a map from 1775. In 1775 the Shawmut peninsula was still connected to the mainland by this narrow strip of land called the "neck". Everything between the 1775 shoreline and the current one is made land. In 1630, the Shawmut peninsula was 487 acres. That is now surrounded by 500 acres of made land. Altogether Boston has 5250 acres of made land. The Back Bay is the best known example of landmaking in Boston, but there are two other sections of the city with more made land.</p>
            <p>The central waterfront occupies this cove on the east side of the Shawmut.  As you can see, the cove has been filled and the shoreline straightened since 1775.  There are hills on three sides of the cove: Copp's Hill to the north, Fort Hill to the south, and the Trimountain to the west.  The Trimountain had three peaks: Mount Vernon, Beacon Hill, and Pemberton Hill.  Today Beacon Hill and Copp's Hill are smaller than they were in 1775.  Fort Hill and Pemberton Hill are gone entirely.  You will hear more about changes to the shoreline and hills later in the tour.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Mill Pond &amp; Creek</h3>
            <p>We are standing here, at the corner of Hanover and Blackstone Streets, near the first engineering project that changed the face of Boston.  In 1630 there was a cove here on the north side of the Shawmut, with a natural causeway across most of its mouth.  In 1643 the town granted that entire cove to a group of businessmen on the condition that they build and maintain gristmills. The mouth of the cove was dammed, and a millstream dug from the cove across the peninsula to the harbor, along what is now Blackstone Street. The cove and stream became known as the Mill Pond and Mill Creek. </p>
            <p>The mills were powered by the tide.  Water entered the Mill Pond at high tide through the Mill Creek and through floodgates in the causeway. At ebb tide water flowed back out of the Mill Pond, powering tide mills. </p>
            <p>The Mill Creek turned the North End into an island. Traffic to and from the North End had to cross the Mill Creek at one of two drawbridges, one here at Hanover Street and the other back at North Street.  The Mill Creek was the boundary between the North End and the rest of Boston.  Blackstone Street became the boundary when it replaced the Mill Creek in 1828.</p>

            <h3>Boston Mill Corporation</h3>
            <p>The millstone across the street marks where the Mill Creek met the Mill Pond.  In 1800, a new group of owners acquired the mills, who appeared to be more interested in making and selling land than in operating mills.  They closed the floodgates on the west side of the causeway, and stopped the periodic plowing of the Mill Creek that maintained its depth.  As a result, both the pond and creek became shallow and stagnant.  On top of that, people disposed of dead animals by throwing them into the Mill Pond.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Bulfinch Triangle</h3>
            <p>In 1807 the town and the Boston Mill Corporation reached an agreement on filling the Mill Pond.  Charles Bulfinch drew up the street plan for the new land, in the shape of a triangle.  The base of the triangle was the new Causeway Street, built partially on the original causeway.  The apex of the triangle was near the spot where the Mill Creek met the Mill Pond.  A canal would run down the center of the triangle from the apex to Causeway Street, extending the Mill Creek to the Charles River.  This connected the central waterfront to the end of the Middlesex Canal across the Charles.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Cutting Down the Hills...</h3>
            <p>The filling of the Mill Pond took over 20 years.  The fill came from Copp's Hill and Beacon Hill.  This was the beginning of the process of "cutting down the hills to fill the coves".  Today, Beacon Hill is about 60 shorter than it was in 1630.  The fill was dug by hand and transported by horse drawn carts.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Railroads</h3>
            <p>The age of the railroad started in the 1830's.  The Boston and Lowell Railroad entered Boston from the north over the Charles River.  Land was made on the other side of Causeway Street for its depot in 1835.  The fill used came from cutting down Pemberton Hill.  In 1845 the Boston and Maine opened a passenger depot in Haymarket Square.  The canal was filled, and the track ran along the new Canal Street.  Other railroads built depots on the far side of Causeway Street, on made land east of the Boston and Maine tracks.  In 1893 these were consolidated into a Union Station, on the future site of North Station.</p>

            <h3>Big Dig Stuff</h3>
            <p>That building across the street is part of the Big Dig, which we will talk about next.  It is ventilation building #4.  Huge fans below ground pull fresh air into the central artery tunnel and push exhaust air out, through that building.</p>
            <p>The stone line in the lawn there marks the shoreline of the Mill Pond in the early 18th century, discovered by an archaeological investigation that was done during the Big Dig.</p>
            <p>That is the Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge.  It is the world's widest cable-stayed bridge.  The original concept for the bridge was developed by Swiss engineer Christian Menn.  Note that the top of its towers are each in the shape of an obelisk, like the Bunker Hill Memorial.  It was part of the Big Dig, which we will talk about at our next stop.</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Elevated Highway</h3>
            <p>This area has twice been transformed by large highway projects.  The original central artery was an elevated highway built in the 1950's.  Construction started on the north and proceeded through this area towards South Station.  Building were demolished and the street plan changed to make room for the highway.  Like the Mill Creek before it, the new elevated highway here separated the North End from the rest of the city.  Public reaction to it was so negative that the southern end was built as a tunnel instead of an elevated highway as originally planned.  The Dewey Square Tunnel was the one part of the central artery that was incorporated into the new highway.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Big Dig</h3>
            <p>The elevated highway was designed to carry 75,000 cars per day.  By the 1990's it was actually carrying almost 200,000 cars per day, with bumper-to-bumper traffic for 6 to 8 hours each day.  Congress approved federal funding for the Big Dig in 1987.  Construction started in 1991 and finished in 2006.   The cost of the project was $24B.  The Big Dig included the Zakim Bridge, O'Neil Tunnel, and Ted Williams Tunnel.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>O'Neil Tunnel</h3>
            <p>Construction of the new central artery would have been faster and cheaper if the elevated highway had been torn down first, and then the tunnel built in its place.  But traffic had to keep flowing in and out of the city.  So it was like rebuilding an airplane while in flight.  Here is a highly simplified description of how it was done:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Build the walls for the tunnel without digging the tunnel.</li>
                <li>Build a temporary support structure for the elevated highway resting on the tunnel walls.</li>
                <li>Remove the original support structure for the elevated highway.</li>
                <li>Excavate the area between the walls and build the tunnel there while traffic continues to flow on the elevated highway above.</li>
                <li>When the tunnel is done, switch traffic from the elevated highway to the tunnel.  This happened in 2003.</li>
                <li>Tear down the elevated highway and the temporary support structure.</li>
                <li>Create the Kennedy Greenway over the tunnel.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Slurry Wall</h3>
            <p>The tunnel were built using the slurry wall technique.  On each side of the tunnel, a trench the width of the tunnel wall was dug all the way down to bedrock.  To keep the trench walls from collapsing, a mix of water a clay called slurry was pumped in as the earth was dug out.  Next, the steel reinforcement cage was fabricated on site and lowered into the trench in sections.  Then concrete was poured in, displacing the slurry, which was pumped out.  The temporary support structure for the elevated highway made it possible to construct the tunnel itself using the same “cut and cover” technique as was used to build the original subway tunnel along Tremont Street a century earlier.</p>

            <h3>Sumner Tunnel</h3>
            <p>This is the Sumner Tunnel.  It connects East Boston to the center of the city.  It opened in 1934, and is the oldest of the three tunnels under the harbor that carry automobile traffic.  Recall that the first transportation tunnel under the harbor was the 1904 subway tunnel.  Obviously you cannot use the cut and cover method for tunnels under the harbor.  These tunnels were constructed using what is called a shield, a steel cylinder mechanism that was invented by Brunel in 1818 and first used to construct a tunnel under the Thames in London.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Callahan Tunnel</h3>
            <p>The Sumner Tunnel has two lanes.  Initially there was one lane in each direction, with tollbooths at either end.  When the central artery was built, there was no direct connection to the Sumner Tunnel.  Traffic had to pass through a traffic light here to get to an entrance ramp to the northbound highway, or travel a couple blocks through the North End to get to a southbound entrance ramp.  Use of the tunnel increased in the 1950's with the central artery and a boom in air travel.  The neighboring Callahan opened in 1961   Since 1962 eastbound traffic has used the Callahan and westbound traffic used the Sumner.  In 1983 tolls were no longer collected on the Callahan Tunnel, to improve the flow of traffic during afternoon rush hour.</p>

    <div data-role="content">
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Landmaking</h3>
            <p>This is North Street again.  Earlier we stopped over there at North and Blackstone and talked about the Mill Creek.  North Street follows the original shoreline here.  Landmaking moved the shoreline north of Quincy Market out to its current location in three phases during the 19th century.  The first phase created the next two streets, Fulton Street and Commercial, and the blocks behind them.  Cross Street, which ran across the peninsula from the Mill Cove to the harbor, was extended to Commercial Street.  The streets were completed by 1830.</p>
            <p>You can see the portico at the harbor end of the Quincy Market building over there.  The new section of Commercial Street ran from the northeast corner of the Faneuil Hall Marketplace to Lewis Wharf.</p>
            <p>The second phase of landmaking here created the block on the far side of Commercial Street in 1856.  This granite building was constructed on the made land.  At that time, the building continued the your right, across today's Kennedy Greenway.  Cross Street dead ended here.</p>
            <p>Note the steel beam with the number 32 stenciled on it.  It was part of the temporary support structure that help up the elevated central artery during the big dig.  You can see how close that highway came to Quincy Market.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Mercantile Wharf</h3>
            <p>This is Mercantile Wharf.  It sits on the land that was made in 1856.  The architect was Gridley Fox Bryant, who also designed the Old City Hall (on School Street) and the State Street Block (next to the Custom House).  Mercantile Wharf and the State Street Block are excellent examples of the Boston granite style.  As you can see there, it was actually called as the Mercantile Wharf Buildings (plural), because it was subdivided into bays that were each three windows wide.  These were sold separately.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Bryant vs. Automobile</h3>
            <p>The automobile was not kind to Bryant's work.  The west end of this building was cut off in 1933 when Cross Street was extended to improve traffic flow between the waterfront and the new Sumner Tunnel.  The brick wall that you see today was originally an internal wall separating two units.  Most of the State Street Block was demolished in the 1950's to make way for the central artery.</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Fort Hill</h3>
            <p>The third phase of landmaking moved the shoreline from Mercantile Wharf to here.  In the 1860's Boston had two problems that lead to two large projects.  One was Fort Hill.  In the 1840's it had become a densely packed slum populate by Irish immigrants.  It was the center of a cholera epidemic in 1849.  Fort Hill was adjacent to the downtown business district, and the powers that be decided to take down the hill and develop the land for commercial use.  The Fort Hill project started in 1865.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Atlantic Avenue</h3>
            <p>The other problem had to do with transportation.  Boston was losing business because it was difficult t ship freight through the city.  The two railroad stations at present day North and South Stations were not connected.  The plan that was adopted was to connect them by creating a new street along a straight line between Rowes wharf and Lewis wharf, with railroad track on it.  In 1867 the Atlantic Avenue project started.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Land Fill</h3>
            <p>The Atlantic Avenue project needed fill for the new street and the made land behind it.  The Fort Hill project needed a place to put the hill that it was tearing down.  So the two projects became linked, in another example of cutting down the hills to fill the coves.  This time, excavation was done using steam shovels, and the fill was transported by rail.  By 1872 both projects were completed and buildings started to go up on the new land.  The Union Freight Railroad operated on Atlantic Avenue until 1970.  Atlantic Avenue cut through the middle of several wharf buildings.  If you walk up the street here to Commercial Wharf, you can see how the street cuts it in half.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Columbus Park</h3>
            <p>Atlantic Avenue was moved inland in the 1970's, opening up space between its current location and the waterfront.  Christopher Columbus Park here opened in 1976.  The Long Wharf Marriott opened in 1980.  The lobby through its center sits on the old path of Atlantic Avenue, and is a public walkway.</p>

            <p>Back in 1715 when Long Wharf was new, the view from here was quite different.  Back then he inner harbor was much larger.  There was no airport on your left.  There was no South Boston seaport district on your right.</p>

It sits about halfway between the current shoreline and the original shoreline.  All of the land that you see from the Fort Point Channel all the way out to Castle Island is made land.</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Ted Williams Tunnel</h3>
            <p>Today, the Ted Williams tunnel connects South Boston and East Boston. It was built by "immersed tube construction".  The tunnel is a pair of steel tubes, one for traffic in each direction.  The 300 long sections were fabricated in Baltimore, floated up the coast, sunk into a trench that was dug into the harbor floor, and connected with giant gaskets.</p>
            <p>At the airport end of the tunnel you can see Ventilation Building #7, next to Terminal A.  The tall stacks on the left are for exhaust and the lower stacks air on the right side are for the intake air.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mill Creek</strong>: in the 1640's the Mill Creek entered the Town Cove just to the right of the Town Dock.</li>
                <li><strong>Long Wharf</strong>: in 1715 Long Wharf extends from the shoreline out to here.  Then, like now, you could see the Old State House from here.</li>
                <li><strong>Faniuel Hall Marketplace</strong>: in 1825 the Town Dock has been replaced by the new marketplace.  The portico on this side of the central market building in on the new shoreline.</li>
                <li><strong>Mercantile Wharf and State Street Block</strong>: in 1856 the Mercantile Wharf Buildings appears on newly made land to the right of the Faniuel Hall Marketplace.  In 1858 the State Street Block appears on land made to the left of Long Wharf.</li>
                <li><strong>Atlantic Avenue</strong>: by 1872 the shoreline of the Town Cove has been moved out and straightened by the new Atlantic Avenue.  Freight trains run along it.  Fort Hill, which was previously visible from here, is gone.</li>
                <li><strong>Elevated Railroad</strong>: in 1901 there is an elevated railway running along Atlantic Avenue, above the freight railroad.  This blocks the view from here of the Old State House.</li>
                <li><strong>Custom House Tower</strong>: in 1915 the Custom House Tower is completed.</li>
                <li><strong>Central Artery</strong>: the elevated railway on Atlantic Avenue is torn down in 1941, restoring the view of the Old State House.  But the view is blocked again in the 1950's by the elevated central artery.</li>
                <li><strong>Big Dig</strong>: in 2004 the elevated central artery is torn down, replaced by the O'Neil tunnel, and the view of the Old State House restored.</li>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>And the changes will continue in the future.  Right now a 60 story building is going up on Washington Street, on the site of the old Filene's building.</p>

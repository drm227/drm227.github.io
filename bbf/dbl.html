            <p>In 1643 Boston granted the North Cove to a group of businessmen on the condition that they build and maintain gristmills. The mouth of the cove was dammed, and a millstream dug from the cove across the peninsula to the harbor, along what is now Blackstone Street. The cove and stream became known as the Mill Pond and Mill Creek. </p>
            <p>The mills were powered by the tide.  Water entered the Mill Pond at high tide through the Mill Creek and through floodgates in the causeway. At ebb tide water flowed back out of the Mill Pond, powering tide mills. </p>

        <h1>Charles River Basin</h1>
        <a href="#westbay">Next</a>
    </div>
    <div data-role="content">
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Before &amp; After</h3>
            <p>The river between the Museum of Science and the BU Bridge is called the Charles River Basin.  What you see today is an artificial, man-made environment that bears little resemblance to the natural environment from which it was sculpted.</p>
            <p>Today, fresh water flows downstream through the Charles River Basin to the harbor.</p>
            <p>Originally, this was a tidal estuary.  Fresh water flowed downstream at low tide.  But at hide tide, salt water from the harbor backed up into here.  The river effectively reversed direction with each change of the tide.</p>
            <p>Today, the water level and width of the river remain constant.  The river is one third of a mile wide at the Harvard Bridge.</p>
            <p>Originally, the water level varied with the tide. So the river was wider at high tide than at low tide. At high tide, it was two miles wide, stretching from Washington Street in the South End to Central Square in Cambridge.</p>
            <p>Today, the shoreline is straight and lined with parkland.</p>
            <p>The original shoreline consisted of tidal mudflats and marshes that were underwater at high tide and exposed at low tide. It was not straight, but wound along bays, coves and points.</p>
            <p>Today, the river is used for recreational boating.  Previously, the traffic on the river was primarily commercial shipping.  Back then, all of the bridges opened to let ships through.  Nown there are only a couple bridges that still open.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>1910 Dam</h3>
            <p>The transformation of the Charles River Basin was not the result of a single project.  It evolved over decades.  The Boston and Cambridge sides developed independently.  Many plans for the basin were proposed, starting in the mid-19th century.  Several of these drew inspiration from the Alster Basin in Hamburg, Germany.  The plan that had the most influence on the ultimate result was one published in 1894 by landscape architect Charles Elliott.  Elliott  started out working as an apprentice for Olmstead.  In the 1890's he was appointed landscape architect for both the Boston and Cambridge park commissions.</p>
            <p>The biggest single step in the long transformation of the Charles Basin took place in 1910.  In that year the first Charles River Dam and Boston Embankment both opened.</p>
            <p>The Charles River Dam isolated the river from the tide, preventing salt water from flowing upstream into the basin.  Sluice gates in the dam were used to maintain the water level at a constant 8 feet above mean low tide (called grade 8).  The mud flats that had been exposed at low tide were now permanently under water.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Lock</h3>
            <p>The Museum of Science sits on the 1910 Charles River Dam.  The earthen dam and the structures on it were designed by engineer Hiram Miller and architect Guy Lowell.  It had a lock here on the Boston side, and sluice gates on the Cambridge side.  The lock is 350 feet long and 45 feet wide.  There is an electrically operated sliding gate at each end.  The lock gates and sluice gates have been kept in the open position ever since the new dam opened downstream in 1978.</p>
            <p>There is a lock house on your right next to each gate, to protect the sliding lock mechanism.  The downstream lock house has a tower for the bridge tender.  It originally had a residence for the lock superintendent that was converted to a police station, now used by the state police.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Drawbridge</h3>
            <p>Immediately after exiting the lock, we will pass under the drawbridge for the Monsignor O'Brien Highway.  This is one of the bridges that still opens.  It is a double leaf bascule bridge.  When the bridge opens, each leaf turns on a hinge mechanism called a trunnion.</p>

            <h3>Lechmere Viaduct</h3>
            <p>Immediately after the drawbridge we'll pass under the Lechmere Viaduct.  That's the concrete arch bridge that runs parallel to the highway, alongside the dam.  Look to your left for the best view.  The viaduct was built in 1912 to extend the Boston Elevated Railway over to East Cambridge.  Now it is used by the Green Line.  It was designed by Peabody & Stearns.</p>
            <p>The viaduct has 12 arches.  All of them are made of concrete except for the one we passed under.  It was originally a double leaf bascule bridge.  It has since been replaced by a steel fixed span.</p>
            <p>The Lechmere Viaduct served another purpose besides extending the BERy.  It was designed to provide an attractive eastern terminus for the Charles River Basin, hiding the commercial district downstream.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>NorthPoint</h3>
            <p>The area on your left is now called NorthPoint.  It sits on 42 acres of land, as in not yet complete.</p>
            <p>The first buildings in the development were the pair of towers with the triangular pediments along the roofline.  Those are the Regatta Riverview Residences.  They were designed by TRO Jung Branned Associates, and opened in 1998.</p>
            <p>The building behind and to the left of the Regatta Riverview Residences is Avalon North Point.   It opened in 2008.  It is the most prominent building visiually in North Point after dark.  The top section is enclosed in translucent glass and lit from within at night.</p>
            <p>The office building with the initials "EF" is the US headquarters for the Education First corporation.  It was designed by Sedish architect Gert Wingardh, and opened in 2014.  The dramatic feature zigzagging down the facade is an abstract waterfall.</p>
            <p>The residential tower behind the EF building opened last year.  It was designed by CBT.  It is called the twenty20, because it is a twenty story building located at 20 Child Street.</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Nort Bank Park</h3>
            <p>The North Point Park along the river opened in 2007.  It was designed by Carr, Lynch, and Sandell.  Before NorthPoint, this area was occupied by an industrial park.  A $14 million project cleaned up the "mildly contaminated" soil prior to the construction of the park.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Nashua Street</h3>
            <p>The building on the right is the Suffolk County Jail.  It was designed by Stubbins Associations and completed in 1990.</p>
            <p>The Nashua Street Park along the river was designed by Halvorson Design Partnership.  It was created with Big Dig mitigation funds.</p>
            <p>The building downstream from the jail was formerly the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.  Spaulding moved to its new location in Charlestown in 2013.  We'll see that later in the cruise.  This building is now used by Mass General for office and research space.</p>
            <p>The 39 story building going up farther back is Avalon North Station.  It is a luxury residential complex designed by CBT.  It is scheduled to be finished later this year.</p>

            <p>This is a 700 foot long tubular steel truss bridge.  It is called a sinusoidal bridge because the trusses rise over the walkway in some places, and dip below it in others.</p>

            <h3>Bulfinch Triangle</h3>
            <p>In 1800, a new group of owners acquired the mills, who appeared to be more interested in making and selling land than in operating mills.  They closed the floodgates on the west side of the causeway, and stopped the periodic plowing of the Mill Creek that maintained its depth.  As a result, both the pond and creek became shallow and stagnant.  On top of that, people disposed of dead animals by throwing them into the Mill Pond.</p>
            <p>In 1807 the town and the Boston Mill Corporation reached an agreement on filling the Mill Pond.  Charles Bulfinch drew up the street plan for the new land, in the shape of a triangle.  The base of the triangle was the new Causeway Street, built partially on the original causeway.  The apex of the triangle was near the spot where the Mill Creek met the Mill Pond.  A canal would run down the center of the triangle from the apex to Causeway Street, extending the Mill Creek to the Charles River.  This connected the central waterfront to the end of the Middlesex Canal across the Charles.</p>
            <p>The filling of the Mill Pond took over 20 years.  The fill came from Copp's Hill and Beacon Hill.  This was the beginning of the process of <em class="highlight">"cutting down the hills to fill the coves"</em>.  Today, Beacon Hill is about 60 shorter than it was in 1630.  The fill was dug by hand and transported by horse drawn carts.</p>

Like an ordinary bascule bridge, the 629 ton overhead counterweight balances the weight of the bridge deck.   When the deck goes up, the counterweight goes down.  The center of gravity of the whole structure does not move up or down.</p>
            <p>Unlike an ordinary bascule bridge, these bridges to not pivot on a trunnion.  Instead, they roll back on their heels, moving away from the river as they open.  If you look closely, you can just make out the cleats on the heel that slide into holes in the track on which it rolls.</p>
            <p>The bridges are controlled from the Signal Tower A building on the far side of the tracks.  It one of an extensive network of signal towers in the vast Boston &amp; Maine rail yard that used to stretch a mile from here to Sullivan Square.</p>

            <h3>Zakim Bridge</h3>
            <p>Next is the Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge.  It is a steel and concrete cable-stayed bridge that was designed by Christian Menn and Miguel Rosales.  It opened in 2003.</p>
            <p>The bridge is 1432 feet long.  The main deck is 8 lanes wide.  There are two additional lanes cantilevered on the far side of the bridge.  It was the world's widest cable stayed bridge when it opened. </p>
            <p>Leonard Zakim was a Jewish-American religious and civil rights leader in Boston.</p>
            <p>The bridge has 116 cables in a harp (parallel) design.  The two cantilevered lanes and the slope of the bridge result in an asymmetrical cable pattern supporting the road decks.</p>
            <p>The shape of the bridge is intended to convey a couple historical associations.  The tops of the towers are obelisks, like the Bunker Hill Memorial.  The cables suggest the rigging of the U.S.S. Constitution that we will see in Charlestown.</p>
            <p>As we go under the bridge you will notice patches of light on the river from diamond-shaped cutouts in the roadbed above. These are for the benefit of the Alewife, a species of herring which will not swim into dark patches of water. The cutouts allow sunlight to pass down to the water so that the Alewife will not be deterred from swimming under the bridge to get upriver to spawn.</p>

            <h3>Paul Revere Park</h3>
            <p>On the left, past the Zakim Bridge, is the Paul Revere Park.  During the Big Dig that space was used as a construction staging zone for the new highway tunnel under City Square.</p>
            <p>The new park opened in 1999,  It too was mitigation for the Big Dig.  It is what Olmstead called a "country park", a planted pastoral oasis.</p>
            <p>There is a pedestrian walkway between Charlestown and Boston here, over the new dam and locks.  If you look closely at its railing on this side of the pumping station, you will see some shiny horizontal tubes.  Those the the "Charlestown Bells", an interactive musical sculpture by Paul Matisse.</p>

            <h3>Gridley Locks &amp; Pumping Station</h3>
            <p>We are coming up on the the new Charles River Dam, which consists of an earthen dam, locks, and a pumping station.  This opened in 1978.  Its purpose was to improve flood control for the Charles River.</p>
            <p>Three hurricanes (1938, 1954, and 1960) caused flooding on both sides of Charles.  The sluice gates in the old dam could not handle the combination of unusually high volume of water coming down the Charles and storm tides in the harbor.</p>
            <p>The new dam was built by the Army Corps of Engineers.  It got its first test in 1978, after the complex was complete but before it was formally dedicated.  The blizzard of 1978 produced record a high tide 15 feet above mean low water.  The pumps were turned on so that the Charles flowed uphill into the harbor.</p>
            <p>The pumping station contains six pumps, each powered by a 2700hp deisel engine.  Their total capacity is over 3 million gallons per minute.</p>
            <p>The pumping station and locks are named for Colonel Richard Gridley, George Washington's chief engineer in the Continental Army.  Gridley engineered the fortifications at the Battle of Bunker Hill in 1775, and the ones at Dorchester Heights that ended the siege of Boston in 1776.</p>
            <p>We'll go through one of the locks to get to the harbor.  The locks act as elevators for boats, moving them between the water level in the river (grade 8) and the water level in the harbor.  At the moment, the harbor is at low/high tide, so the elevator will be going down/up.  There are mosaic tile height markers near the doors of the locks.</p>

            <h3>Charlestown Bridge</h3>
            <p>After leaving the lock, we'll pass under one more bridge before entering the harbor, the Charlestown Bridge.  It was designed by city engineer William Jackson, and opened in 1900.  We'll see three more bridges by Jackson on our cruise.</p>
            <p>This is a steel truss swing span bridge.  A swing bridge opens by rotating its center span 90 degrees, making space on both sides for ships to pass.</p>
            <p>This is a rim-bearing swing bridge.  The pier on which the swing span sits has a circular track on top.  A ring of wheels on the underside of the swing span sit on this track, and roll along the track when the bridge rotates.</p>
            <p>If you look closely at the steel truss superstructure on the swing span, you can see the remains of a second deck.  The entire bridge originally has a second deck for the Boston Elevated Railway.  The elevated tracks were removed in 1975 when the Orange Line subway tunnel opened.  Now the trains go under rather than over the river.</p>
            <p>Trains coming coming to Boston from Charlestown on the elevated tracks came to a fork after passing over the bridge.  The right fork took trains to the tunnel under the center of the city.  The left fork continued as elevated tracks along the waterfront all the way down past South Station.  The two routes rejoined where the tunnel came out in Chinatown.</p>
            <p>This bridge replaced the Charles River Bridge that opened in 1786.  That was the first bridge over the Charles.  It was a draw bridge, not a swing bridge.  Before the Charles River bridge there was a ferry service here.  In 1640 Massachusetts granted the revenue from that ferry to support Harvard College.  The Charles River Bridge was required to pay Harvard &pound;200 annually to make up for the lost revenue.</p>

            <h3>Harborwalk</h3>
            <p>A near-continuous, 43-mile linear park along Boston’s shoreline, the Harborwalk connects Boston’s waterfront neighborhoods to Boston Harbor and each other.  Nearing completion, it stretches from the Neponset River in lower Dorchester to Constitution Beach in East Boston via Charlestown, the North End, Downtown, Seaport, South Boston and Dorchester.</p>
            <p>The HarborWalk represents a collaborative effort between city and state agencies, property owners, residents and harbor advocacy groups. We will see numerous glimpses of the HarborWalk on our journey today.</p>

            <h3>Buildings</h3>
            <p>The two similar brick buildings facing Washington and Causeway streets were both designed by Codman & Despedrelle in the Classical Revivial style.  They opened in 1906 and 1907, and contained light manufacturing.</p>
            <p>The far building facing Causeway Street was renovated in 2004 by Finegold Alexander Architects as commercial and residential space.</p>
            <p>The building facing Washington Street was renovated for Converse and completed in 2015.  The addition on top was designed by The Architecture Team.  The conversion of the interior to office space was designed by Jennifer Carpenter.</p>
            <p>The new building facing Beverly Street was completed in 2016.  It was designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects, and contains 175 luxury condos.  Unusually, the building has no on-site parking.</p>

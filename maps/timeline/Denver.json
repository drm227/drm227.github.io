The government acquired the Clark, Gruber building and machinery for $25,000 and opened the Denver Mint Assay Office in 1863. Despite its authorization to coin money, the mint did not make coins. It operated only as an assay office, which melted and assayed bullion before returning it to customers. [3 on map]",

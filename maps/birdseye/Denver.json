In 1895 Congress authorized the mint to produce coins and also provided for a new building, which opened in 1904 at the corner of West Colfax Avenue and Cherokee Street. Expanded several times over the twentieth century, the mint now produces billions of coins per year and is one of the most popular attractions in the city.",

Rather, it used the side walls of the buildings that were already there.  Not long after it was built, Mr. Kettle left his building. Kettle himself went into the real estate business.  After Kettle left it, the building housed many different businesses. At various times it served as the home for an employment agency, a knick‐knack store, a newspaper office, and a steam dye works. In terms of design, the building is most notable for its simulated stone facing and the decorative top (cornice) of the building.",

H. Cox’s hometown of Albany, New York) in July 1885. Appealing to those reaping the benefits of a Colorado mining boom, the hotel was decorated in the style of the elegant 1880s with Persian velvet covering the floors and bronze peacock screens guarding the fireplaces. [...] In 1938, the New Albany Hotel reopened after a major design overhaul orchestrated by architect Burnham Hoyt and closed for good on August 27, 1976. Demolition of the hotel building began on November 17, 1976, to make way for Urban Center I, a 29-story office building with adjoining plaza.",

Construction on Denver’s new Capitol building was in the works, and Capitol Hill was the next “Millionaire’s Row.” Built in 1889, the Molly Brown House was one of the earliest homes being built with electricity (rather than being converted from gas). Its local stonework, quarried from Castle Rock and Manitou Springs, represent the uniqueness of Colorado architecture and geology. It also represents a lasting image of the unique work of prominent Denver architect William Lang, who left his final mark on the cityscape before the 1893 crisis. Just four houses on the block were built before the devastation of the silver crash, and only 1340 Pennsylvania remains.",

Rising ten stories and then stepping back twenty feet to a five-story central tower with Gothic turrets, the Telephone Building in Denver was the first to take advantage of a setback provision in the city height ordinance that allowed buildings to rise above twelve stories if their additional height was set back from the street. Topping out at nearly 237 feet, the building was the tallest in Denver (aside from smelter stacks and the Daniels and Fisher Tower) until the 1950s and contained about 5.2 million cubic feet of space.",

In 1889 Byers sold the house to a fellow Tramway executive, William Gray Evans, who was the son of former territorial governor John Evans and the sister of Anne Evans, one of the city’s leading cultural patrons.  After William Evans died in 1924, his wife, sister, and daughters maintained the residence for more than fifty years as the surrounding neighborhood shifted from residential to commercial to cultural. In 1981 the Evans family donated the property to the Colorado Historical Society (now History Colorado), which continues to operate it as the Center for Colorado Women’s History at the Byers-Evans House Museum.",

The large church would occupy the entire site and seat 1,200 people. Ground was broken on February 29, 1924, and the cornerstone was laid on October 5 of that year, but funding did not allow for the full building to be completed. Instead, only the basement was built and a temporary tar roof was erected over it. On December 14, 1924, the church was dedicated in its partially finished state, with about one-third of Benedict’s design completed.",

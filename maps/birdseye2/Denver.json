Rather, it used the side walls of the buildings that were already there.  Not long after it was built, Mr. Kettle left his building. Kettle himself went into the real estate business.  After Kettle left it, the building housed many different businesses. At various times it served as the home for an employment agency, a knick‐knack store, a newspaper office, and a steam dye works. In terms of design, the building is most notable for its simulated stone facing and the decorative top (cornice) of the building.",

H. Cox’s hometown of Albany, New York) in July 1885. Appealing to those reaping the benefits of a Colorado mining boom, the hotel was decorated in the style of the elegant 1880s with Persian velvet covering the floors and bronze peacock screens guarding the fireplaces. [...] In 1938, the New Albany Hotel reopened after a major design overhaul orchestrated by architect Burnham Hoyt and closed for good on August 27, 1976. Demolition of the hotel building began on November 17, 1976, to make way for Urban Center I, a 29-story office building with adjoining plaza.",

Between 1888-1924, the original three-story building grew along with one of Denver’s most successful retail operations.  Founded as the McNamara Dry Goods Company in 1886, the business reorganized as the Denver Dry Goods Company in 1894 and continued to serve its customers well into the 1980s.  The downtown store was noted for its wide range of merchandise and large tea room, which served as a popular gathering place. ",

[...] The architectural style Bowman used for the building, which Mountain States called “Modern American Perpendicular Gothic,” was based on Neo-Gothic skyscrapers such as New York’s Woolworth Building (1913) as well as on the New York Telephone Company’s new Art Deco headquarters then under construction, the Barclay-Vesey Building (1927). Rising ten stories and then stepping back twenty feet to a five-story central tower with Gothic turrets, the Telephone Building in Denver was the first to take advantage of a setback provision in the city height ordinance that allowed buildings to rise above twelve stories if their additional height was set back from the street. Topping out at nearly 237 feet, the building was the tallest in Denver (aside from smelter stacks and the Daniels and Fisher Tower) until the 1950s and contained about 5.2 million cubic feet of space.",

After Field moved to Chicago in 1883, the house fell into disrepair until a local group of preservationists convinced Margaret Brown to purchase the house and donate it to the City of Denver in 1927.  As part of this preservation effort, the house was moved from its original site at 315 W. Colfax to its present location in Washington Park, where it has served as a branch of the Denver Public Library system and more recently as the headquarters for Park People.",

[...]  In 1897, three years after the area was annexed by Denver, Mayor Thomas McMurray initiated condemnation proceedings on land south of Smith Lake to create a park that incorporated the lake. By 1904, Washington Park reached its present size through additional land purchases.",

Popular thought at the time was that buildings should reflect the time in which they were built, and so architect Meryll Hoyt (1881-1933) replaced Steele’s Roman, Greek, and Italian Renaissance elements with the Art Deco building we have today.",

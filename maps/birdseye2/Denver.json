Rising ten stories and then stepping back twenty feet to a five-story central tower with Gothic turrets, the Telephone Building in Denver was the first to take advantage of a setback provision in the city height ordinance that allowed buildings to rise above twelve stories if their additional height was set back from the street. Topping out at nearly 237 feet, the building was the tallest in Denver (aside from smelter stacks and the Daniels and Fisher Tower) until the 1950s and contained about 5.2 million cubic feet of space.",

To design the complex, he hired modernist architect I. M. Pei, who filled the blocks with a high-rise hotel made of precast concrete, a large rectangular department store, and a plaza and distinctive hyperbolic paraboloid along Sixteenth. As part of Zeckendorf’s plan for the complex, he arranged the merger of May and Daniels & Fisher; the combined May–D&F department store joined Denver’s first Hilton Hotel as the centerpieces of Courthouse Square, which was completed in 1960.",

Designed by Colorado architect Frederick G. Sterner, the tower was based on St. Mark’s Campanile in Venice, which had collapsed in 1902 and was being rebuilt at the time, inspiring replicas around the world. The Daniels and Fisher Tower would be a few feet taller, though, prompting the Denver Times to joke that Venice was building a smaller copy of Denver’s tower.",

The elegant neoclassical building houses the mayor, city council, many county and district courts, and other city offices. Conceived as part of Charles Mulford Robinson’s original City Beautiful Plan of 1906, which placed it on the north side of West Colfax Avenue, it took twenty-six years to materialize due to extended legal, political, and architectural battles. Completed in 1932 at a final cost of more than $5.5 million, it has not been altered much over the decades.",

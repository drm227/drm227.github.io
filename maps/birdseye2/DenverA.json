The government acquired the Clark, Gruber building and machinery for $25,000 and opened the Denver Mint Assay Office in 1863. Despite its authorization to coin money, the mint did not make coins. It operated only as an assay office, which melted and assayed bullion before returning it to customers. [3 on map]",

Appealing to those reaping the benefits of a Colorado mining boom, the hotel was decorated in the style of the elegant 1880s with Persian velvet covering the floors and bronze peacock screens guarding the fireplaces. [...] In 1938, the New Albany Hotel reopened after a major design overhaul orchestrated by architect Burnham Hoyt and closed for good on August 27, 1976. Demolition of the hotel building began on November 17, 1976, to make way for Urban Center I, a 29-story office building with adjoining plaza.",

[...] The architectural style Bowman used for the building, which Mountain States called “Modern American Perpendicular Gothic,” was based on Neo-Gothic skyscrapers such as New York’s Woolworth Building (1913) as well as on the New York Telephone Company’s new Art Deco headquarters then under construction, the Barclay-Vesey Building (1927). Rising ten stories and then stepping back twenty feet to a five-story central tower with Gothic turrets, the Telephone Building in Denver was the first to take advantage of a setback provision in the city height ordinance that allowed buildings to rise above twelve stories if their additional height was set back from the street. Topping out at nearly 237 feet, the building was the tallest in Denver (aside from smelter stacks and the Daniels and Fisher Tower) until the 1950s and contained about 5.2 million cubic feet of space.",

In 1889 Byers sold the house to a fellow Tramway executive, William Gray Evans, who was the son of former territorial governor John Evans and the sister of Anne Evans, one of the city’s leading cultural patrons.  After William Evans died in 1924, his wife, sister, and daughters maintained the residence for more than fifty years as the surrounding neighborhood shifted from residential to commercial to cultural. In 1981 the Evans family donated the property to the Colorado Historical Society (now History Colorado), which continues to operate it as the Center for Colorado Women’s History at the Byers-Evans House Museum.",

Prominent Denver architect Jules Jacques Benois Benedict was hired to design the building. Completed in December 1923, Benedict’s plan called for a blend of Spanish and Italian Renaissance architecture that would provide the “directness and simplicity” that he believed were desirable in a downtown church. The large church would occupy the entire site and seat 1,200 people. Ground was broken on February 29, 1924, and the cornerstone was laid on October 5 of that year, but funding did not allow for the full building to be completed. Instead, only the basement was built and a temporary tar roof was erected over it. On December 14, 1924, the church was dedicated in its partially finished state, with about one-third of Benedict’s design completed.",

Construction on Denver’s new Capitol building was in the works, and Capitol Hill was the next “Millionaire’s Row.” Built in 1889, the Molly Brown House was one of the earliest homes being built with electricity (rather than being converted from gas). Its local stonework, quarried from Castle Rock and Manitou Springs, represent the uniqueness of Colorado architecture and geology. It also represents a lasting image of the unique work of prominent Denver architect William Lang, who left his final mark on the cityscape before the 1893 crisis. Just four houses on the block were built before the devastation of the silver crash, and only 1340 Pennsylvania remains.",

When Coquard came down with an illness, the Denver firm of Aaron Gove and Thomas Walsh supervised the project. Constructed with Indiana limestone on a foundation of Colorado granite, the building measured 195 feet long and 116 feet wide, with a pair of twin spires that rose 210 feet above East Colfax Avenue. The interior was decorated with statuary of Italian Carrara marble, stained-glass windows made by the Royal Bavarian Institute in Germany, and a massive 3,000-pipe Kimball organ. The pews could seat 1,500, the largest capacity of any church in the city. ",

          "description":"The 1910 ten-story Sullivanesque style building was designed by prominent Denver architect Harry W.J. Edbrooke for the Denver Gas and Electric Company, reportedly as a promotional tool.  The somewhat fanciful structure, considered by many to be Denver’s grandest illuminated building, is distinguished by its terra cotta cladding and the 13,000 electric light bulbs that form geometric patterns around and between the primarily double hung windows.

A two-story arcade embracing storefront and second-story office windows is highlighted by radiating stone trim beneath a double-corniced third story. Quarry-face brown sandstone laid in a vernacular Richardsonian Romanesque mode exhibits the eccentric, ornate detailing that hallmarked Lang's work. Built at 15th Street and Glenarm Place, the building was reconstructed here after being disassembled stone by stone. The resurrected Ghost Block reopened in 1990 as a popular restaurant featuring Old West food and drink and New West decor.",

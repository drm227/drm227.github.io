            <h3>This Tour</h3>
            <p>Welcome to today’s tour of the Lower Downtown Historic District.  My name is Dennis McCarthy.  I am a volunteer tour guide with Historic Denver.  Historic Denver was founded in 1970.  It focuses on historic preservation and advocacy.  It also operates the Molly Brown house museum, and offers walking tours of Denver’s historic neighborhoods.  Today we will be walking in a loop through Lower Downtown, finishing up one block down the street.,  This tour lasts 90 minutes.</p>
            <p>Lower Downtown, also known as LoDo, has two patterns.  One is historical.  The other is architectural.  At each stop on the tour we will see those two patterns play out, with many variations and a few exceptions.</p>

            <h3>Denver History</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Historical Pattern</h3>
            <p>The historical pattern is three periods: development, decline, and transformation.  LoDo originally developed in the late 1800’s and early 1900’s as a commercial district, with many warehouses for wholesale businesses.  Then it went into decline in the decades after WWII, becoming a “skid row”.  Finally, starting in the 1980s, it was transformed into the residential neighborhood you see today.</p>
            <p>On our tour today you will see many older buildings that have been transformed rather than replaced.  This was a result of LoDo being  designated an historic district in 1988.  Historic Denver played a leading role in that process.  In architecture and development, converting an old building to a new purpose is called “adaptive reuse”.   You can see many examples of this on the other side of the street, which is knows as “warehouse row”.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Architectural Pattern</h3>
            <p>The buildings from that initial development period exhibit the commercial style of their time.  On the outside, they are organized into three layers: bottom, middle and top.  I’ll explain this further when we get to our first building in this style.</p>
            <p>There are a couple names that you will hear many times on this tour.  One is the architectural firm Gove and Walsh.  Aaron Gove and Thomas Walsh formed their partnership in 1894.  They designed many of the buildings here in LoDo, contributing to the district’s consistent commercial style.</p>
            <p>The other name is developer Dana Crawford.  She is best known for her preservation efforts in Larimer Square, but was also involved in several of the adaptive reuse projects we will see on this tour.</p>

    </div>
    <div data-role="content">
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Railroads</h3>
            <p>We are going to start with the most important building in LoDo - Union Station.</p>
            <p>Railroads played an essential role in Denver’s history.  During the 1860’s Denver’s population remained around 5000.  In the 1870’s it grew from 5000 to 35,000.  What happened to trigger that growth?  Starting in 1871, railroads connected Denver to the rest of the country.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Union Depot & Station</h3>
            <p>By the end of the 1870’s, Denver was served by many railroads with separate stations.   The city decided to consolidate these into a single, shared facility, called the Union Depot.  It opened here in 1881.  That station was an Italian Romanesque design by William Taylor.  It consisted of a center section with wings on either side.  Show photo.  It was 503 feet long and 32 feet wide.  The wings you see today are original, but the center has been replaced.</p>
            <p>By the early 20th century the station needed to expand to keep up with the  growing volume of traffic.  So the center section was replaced by a larger structure, in a different style.  It was designed by Gove and Walsh, and opened in 1914.  The new building had a larger footprint, extending far out from the wings towards Wynkoop Street.  This is not the commercial style.  It is called the Beaux Arts style, and is derived from classical architecture.  It certainly looks monumental.</p>
            <p>What is the exterior made of?  Granite base, terra-cotta tile above, finished to resemble granite.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Disuse and Reuse</h3>
            <p>In the decades after WWII, railroads declined as more Americans chose to travel by car or airplane rather than train.  That “Travel By Train” sign was added in 1953, visible evidence of the competition.  By the 1980s the number of trains stopping here daily had dropped from a peak of more than 80 down to 2. Gradually space inside the building switched from railroad functions to other uses.  And it fell into disrepair, like most of LoDo.</p>
            <p>In 2001 the RTD purchased Union Station.  In 2004 it adopted its FasTrack plan, in which Union Station would become part of a multi-modal transportation center.  In 2016 new commuter rail lines started service in and out of Union Station.</p>
            <p>The building was renovated between 2012 and 2014.  The exterior was restored, and much of the interior was reconfigured into a hotel.  What’s the name of that hotel?  Dana Crawford was part of the team that won the contract to do the renovation.</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Denver City Railway</h3>
            <p>The building behind me, across the street, opened in 1883 as the main terminal for the Denver City Railway Company.  Denver City Railway started the city’s first horse-drawn streetcar line in 1871.  Union Station first became part of a multi-modal transportation center in 1883.  Passenger arriving by train, bound for placed in Denver beyond LoDo, could cross Wynkoop Street and board a streetcar.  Today they board a bus in the underground concourse behind Union Station.</p>
            <p>In 1883 this building looked very different than what you see today, as you can see in this old photo.  Show photo.  It had a waiting room and car barns on the ground floor.  Horses were stabled on the second and third floors.  Hay and grain for the horses was stored in the attic.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Adaptive Reuse</h3>
            <p>This building underwent its first adaptive reuse in 1892, when it was converted to retail and commercial space.  So adaptive reuse goes back to the 1800’s in Denver.  The commercial style exterior that you see today was designed by the Baerresen brothers, architects who had emigrated from Denmark.</p>
            <p>On the ground floor, the car barn doors were replaced by large windows, but the stone piers between them are original.  The window arrangement on the upper floors was changed.  The gable end facing 17th Street is gone.  The building now appears to be a four story building, rather than a three story building with attic storage.  The windows are arranged in slightly recessed panels, and the top floor window have arched tops.  </p>
            <p>But appearances can be deceiving.  Look up at the top floor windows in the panel nearest us.  If you were standing directly in front of the building, what would you see through those windows?  The sky!</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Use, Disuse and Adaptive Reuse</h3>
            <p>From 1902 to 1972 this was the home of the Hendrie and Boltoff Manufacturing and Supply Company.  This was one of the largest Colorado suppliers of heavy mining equipment, sold throughout the United States.  They used the space for showrooms, offices, storage and manufacturing.</p>
            <p>After 1972 this building sat vacant until its second adaptive reuse, when it was reconfigured into 43 loft condominiums above ground floor retail.  The Streetcar Stable Lofts opened in 1994.</p>

    <div data-role="content">
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>J.S. Brown and Brown Mercantile</h3>
            <p>Now we’re going to look at the Wynkoop Brewing building, diagonally across the intersection.  I like this building because it illustrations several trends in LoDo history and architecture.</p>
            <p>First history.  This building opened in 1899 as the new home for the Brown Mercantile Company.  John Sydney Brown started his wholesale grocery business in Denver in 1861.  Most of the people who came to Denver in its early years were seeking gold.  But some, like Brown, chose to make their fortune by selling necessities to those prospectors.  His business grew to be one of the largest in the region.  Brown was also a “town builder”, one of those early Denver businessmen who invested in projects that would help the city grow.  He was a backer of the Denver Pacific Railroad and of the original Union Depot.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>Now let’s look at the architecture. This building was designed by Gove and Walsh.  Unlike Union Station, this is in the commercial that we’ll see in many LoDo bullrings.  The building originally contained offices, a showroom, and warehouse space.  In addition, the exterior had a marketing purpose: to project the image of a thriving business.</p>
            <p>Notice how the ground floor looks different from the floors above.  On the Wynkoop Street side (your right), there is now a terrace with outdoor seating for the brew pub.  That was originally a loading dock for the railroad siding that ran along that side of the building.  The loading dock was level with the floor of box cars.</p>
            <p>The front of the building is around the corner facing 18th Street (your left).  It has an arched center entrance flanked by large arched Romanesque windows on either side.  The stone foundation rises up to the windows.  That rough cut surface is called rusticated stone.</p>
            <p>On both sides of the building, there is a horizontal stone band that creates a visual boundary between the ground floor and the floors above.  The upper floors have smaller windows, arranged in recessed vertical panels.  Only the top floor windows have arched tops.</p>
            <p>Buildings from this period generally have a horizontal decorative band at the top.  The top of this building extends outward.  That’s called a cornice.  Below the cornice there is a decorative brickwork transition between the cornice and the middle layer.  This is called corbelling.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Disuse and Adaptive Reuse</h3>
            <p>After 1956 this building sat mostly empty.  In 1988, a group of investors formed the Wynkoop Brewing Company.  They purchased and renovated the building, putting a brew pub on the first floor, pool hall on the second floor, and loft residences above.  John Hickenlooper was one of those investors.  He went on to become mayor of Denver, governor of Colorado, and now U.S. senator.</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Littleton/Beatrice Creamery</h3>
            <p>We are looking at a three building complex across the street.  Can you make them out?  These buildings were constructed from left to right for the Littleton Creamery, opening in 1903, 1912 and 1916.  The Littleton Creamery opened in 1889 as a wholesale supplier of dairy products.  It was acquired by Beatrice Foods in 1912.</p>
            <p>Look at the painted sign below the cornice on the building on the left.  It has Beatrice written over Littleton.  These old painted signs for businesses that no longer exist are called ghost signs.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>The first two building were designed by Gove and Walsh.  How do they compare with the other Gove and Walsh building we just saw.  The ground floor has larger windows over a rusticated stone base.  There is a horizontal stone stringcourse between the first and second floors.  And there is a cornice above the fifth floor.  These features span all three buildings.</p>
            <p>But one of the buildings look very different than the other two.  Which one, and why?  The third and fourth stories of the building on the left has a solid brick wall where windows should be.  What’s going on here?  The space behind the wall was refrigerated storage.  Windows let heat or cold in, making temperature control more difficult.  There was also  85,000 cu ft sawdust insulation inside.</p>
            <p>To relieve the monotony of a large blank wall, they used alternating bands of different color bricks.  There is also a diamond pattern in the bricks on the top floor.  The polychrome brickwork and elaborate lintels on the first floor windows are borrowed from the Renaissance Revival style.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Disuse and Adaptive Reuse</h3>
            <p>Beatrice Foods closed this facility in 1979.  It has undergone adaptive reuse twice since then.  In the early 1980’s it was acquired by a group of developers that included Dana Crawford.  They renamed it the Ice House, and converted the space into the Denver Design Center .  This was a complicated example of adaptive reuse.  First the building had to be thawed, which took weeks.  Then the insulation and coolant pipes were removed.</p>
            <p>In 1997 a second group of developers converted the building into 89 condominiums.  Windows were added on the 18th Street side, and balconies were added on two sides of the complex.  It was rebranded as the Ice House.</p>

    <div data-role="content">
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>History and Architecture</h3>
            <p>The building across the intersection opened in 1923 as a freight depot for the Union Pacific RR.  Does it follow the bottom/middle/top pattern?   It does not have a distinct bottom and middle, and the windows are not in recessed panels.  This building was designed by UP engineers, not a Denver architect.  That’s probably why it does not follow the pattern that we see in other buildings.</p>
            <p>The building consists of a head house facing 19th Street, and a long corridor of loading docks behind that.  We’ll get a better view of those on our way to the next stop.  The front faces 19th Street and is dominated by a two story projecting entrance bay.  The entrance has Doric columns on either side and the name of the railroad engraved on a  terra-cotta panel above.  There is a UP logo on the parapet above the cornice.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Disuse and Reuse</h3>
            <p>In its heyday this depot handled 2000 rail cars per day.  So what is missing?  Originally there were rail yards next to the northeast and northwest sides of the building.  These were removed in the 1980’s, and the building fell into disuse.</p>
            <p>In the early 1990’s it was transformed into 36,000 square feet of restaurant and retail space.  That opened in 1995.</p>
            <p>The building changed hands in 2021.  How much do you think a century old freight house in LoDo sold for?  $22.5 million.</p>

    <div data-role="content">
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Denver was awarded a NL expansion franchise in 1991.  The Rockies played the 1993 and 1994 seasons in Mile High Stadium, while this new ball park was under construction.  Coors field opened in 1995.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>This land had previously been occupied by rail yards and a row of warehouses along Blake Street.  One of the design goals for the new stadium was for it to be “contextual”.  That a fancy way of saying that they wanted it to fit in with the older warehouse buildings of LoDo.  So they hired the same architects who had designed Camden Yards in Baltimore (HOK, now Populous).</p>
            <p>The side of the ballpark is a three story brick wall, with structural steel above that.  The brick walls are intended to be reminiscent of the LoDo warehouses.  The bricks were supplied by Robinson Brick and Tile, who started making bricks in Denver in 1880.</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
            <p>What is the Rockies mascot?  Dinger, a triceratops.  Dinosaur bones were uncovered here during construction.</p>
            <p>What is Coors Field noted for?  Home runs, due to dry air, not altitude.  Game baseballs are stored in a humidor.</p>
            <p>Row 20 in the upper deck has purple seats.  They are at elevation one mile.</p>

    <div data-role="content">
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Different Building</h3>
            <p>The building across the street opened in 1931.  It was called the Merchandise Mart at that time.  Does it look different than the buildings that we saw along warehouse row on Wynkoop Street?  Why?</p>
            <p>This is the newest of the old buildings in LoDo.  Styles had changed since 1900.  This building is polychrome, with light and dark colored brick.  The windows on the upper floors are larger, and made up of many smaller panes than in previous buildings.  That is related to its function.  The building was intended to contain showrooms for multiple tenants, not warehouse or manufacturing space for a single tenant.  Because of the Great Depression, that did not work out, and the building ended up being use for office space by multiple tenants.</p>
            <p>How else does the exterior of this building differ from those we saw on warehouse row?  Look at the ground floor.  Is it distinct from the floors above, with larger windows?  No.  There is very little difference between the windows on the first floor and those on the floors above.  You have to look very closely to see a faint brick stringcourse between the first and second floors.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Montana Fallis</h3>
            <p>The Merchandise Mart was designed by architect Montana Fallis.  He came to Denver in 1886 to work for Frank Edbrooke, one of the city’s most prominent architects.  Fallis started his own business in 1914.  We’ll see another building designed by Fallis later in the tour.</p>
            <p>Fallis designed two other Denver buildings that opened the year before this one, an office building and the Mayan Theater.  Has anyone seen the Mayan Theater?  Those two buildings were Art Deco style, with exuberant decorations.  This building has some Art Deco elements, such as repeated patterns and geometric decorations.  But it is much more restrained, due to timing and location.  It was designed after the onset of the Great Depression, and located in the LoDo warehouse district rather than the downtown business district.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Adaptive Reuse</h3>
            <p>This building also has the distinction of never stood having empty during LoDo’s skid row period.  In 1994 it was converted to 47 loft condos.  It was renamed the Rocky Mountain Warehouse Lofts, after one of the tenants at the time.</p>

            <h3>Morey and Morey Mercantile</h3>
            <p>The building diagonally across the intersection is now called the Wazee Exchange, but that name is from the late 20th century.  The building opened around 1884 as the new home of the Morey Mercantile Company.</p>
            <p>Chester Stephen Morey was a Wisconsin native.  He was a Civil War veteran.  After the war he moved to Chicago and worked as a wholesale grocery salesman.  In 1872 he move to Colorado to recover from tuberculosis.  Many people did that in the late 1800’s.  There was even a slang term for them: lungers.  Morey became the manager of the Denver branch of a large Chicago based wholesaler.  In 1884 that became the Morey Mercantile Company.  His company moved into this building the same year.  Morey Mercnantile grew to be one of the largest businesses in the region by 1900.  It moved out of here to a new, larger building 1896, which we will see later in the tour.</p>

            <h3>Building Comparison</h3>
            <p>Morey Mercantile competed with Brown Mercantile.  So how do their buildings compare?</p>
            <p>The front (your right) of this building is very different than the side.  The  two sides of the Brown Mercantile building were identical above the first floor.  Here the front side is more elaborate.  It even uses a different grade of brick.  The bricks on the side are called common bricks.  The ones on the front are called facing bricks.  The facing bricks are smoother and have more uniform color.  They are more expensive.</p>
            <p>Let’s focus on the front of this building.  The overall organization is the same as for the Brown Mercantile building.  The ground floor is distinct from the floors above, with larger windows.  The upper floor windows are arranged in recessed panels.  There is a cornice at the top.  But the details of these are very different.</p>
            <p>The ground floor windows are not set in a brick wall.  There is more glass, almost a window wall.  The windows are framed in what looks like post and beam.  But what you see is more pressed metal decoration, not the underlying structural material.</p>
            <p>On the upper floors, there are two columns of windows in each recessed panel.  The lintels above the windows are made of stone, not brick, with carved decorations.  The lintels on each side-by-side pair of windows in the same panel are attached to each other.</p>
            <p>This cornice is larger and more elaborate.  It is made of pressed metal.  It was fabricated in Brooklyn and shipped here by train.</p>
            <p>So what do you think?  Who won the battle of the buildings, Morey or Brown?</p>

            <h3>Disuse and Reuse</h3>
            <p>By the 1980’s this building sat vacant.  In 2009 it was renovated.  The front facade was restored, and an elevated walkway was added for accessibility .  On the Wazee side, the number of windows was doubled.  Can you tell the new windows from the old ones? The ones with segmental arched lintels are the originals.</p>

            <p>The project also created this “activated alley”.  In LoDo’s skid row period you would have avoided this alley.  Now it’s a destination.  The sculpture here at the alley entrance is called Spilt Milk.  There’s another play on words father down the alley: LoDough Bakery.</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Windsor Farm Dairy</h3>
            <p>The name of the Dairy Block comes from this building.  It opened in 1918 for the Windsor Farm Dairy.  The farm was in SE Denver, and the milk was processed into dairy products here.  This building was designed by Denver architects Fisher & Fisher.  The Window Farm Dairy had a business connection and an architectural connection with the Littleton Creamery that we saw earlier.</p>
            <p>The Windsor Farm Dairy was founded by H. Brown Cannon.  Cannon came to Denver in 1866.  Like Morey, he had tuberculosis.  The business was purchased in 1928 by Beatrice.  Brown then became a director of Beatrice.  Beatrice continued to use this building for dairy processing until 1973.</p>
            <p>Also, it originally had more brick wall with fewer openings for windows and doors, as you can see in this photo.  <i>Show old photo.</i>  At some point after that, windows and doors were added.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>But this building does not have a distinct ground floor like the Littleton Creamery.  The exterior is organized horizontally rather than vertically.  Look at it from left to right.  Do you see the pattern of alternating sections.  One section protrudes, with a door on the ground floor and simple window above.  The next section is recessed and wider, with larger windows on both floors and a terra cotta panel with the name above those.</p>
            <p>Do you see anything unusual about the brickwork?  The mortar between the bricks is deeply inset.</p>

            <p>The corner building across the street was built in 1881 for F.W. Crocker & Co. as a cracker factory.  After a couple mergers it became part of the National Biscuit Co., now known as Nabisco.  Nabisco continued to operate this factory until 1945.  After that, it was used as a warehouse.</p>

            <p>How does this building compare to the Windsor Farm Dairy or the Littleton Creamery?  Like the Littleton Creamery buildings, this one has rusticated stone between the sidewalk and the first floor windows.  It has a cornice on top with corbelling below.  And the upper floor windows are arranged in recessed panels.</p>
            <p>But, like the Windsor Farm Dairy, this building does not have a distinct ground floor.  The ground floor windows a continuation of the upper floors, in the same recessed panels.  There is no stringcourse boundary between the first and second  floors.</p>

            <h3>Blake Street Terrace</h3>
            <p>In 1983 a development project transformed the old factory building into office space and constructed the new Blake Street Terrace next door.  The new building was designed to echo features of the old one.</p>
            <p>How does the Blake Street Terrace resemble the cracker factory?  It has

The building has a cornice made of pressed metal.
            <p>What is different about this building?  The top of each panel is rounded, but the window within is not.  There is a circle inside the semi-circle.  Some of the circles are empty, other have a decorative filling.  Also, Between the second and third floor windows there is a contrasting dark panel with a white terra-cotta triangle.</p>

            <h3>Adaptive Reuse</h3>
            <p>In 1982 the building was restored and converted to offices.  The biggest change on the exterior was adding openings that allow light into the basement, so that it could be rented as office space.  On the Blake Street side (your left), windows were added to an existing loading dock.  On the 18th Street side (your right), look at the low wall with railings along the sidewalk.  There is a light well between it and the building down to the basement floor.  Full size windows were added on the basement wall facing the light well.</p>

This building differs from the others we have seen in one aspect.  It does not extend all the way back to the alley that bisects the block.  There was another building between this one and the alley.  It was a stables, once associated with the nearby Windsor Hotel.  By 1930 that had been replaced by a parking lot.</p>

            <h3>Hotel Row</h3>
            <p>We are back at 17th Street, which runs between Union Station and the downtown business district.  In the late 1800’s, 17th Street became “hotel row”, because of its location.  It was an easy walk from here to the train station, the financial district, and the wholesale businesses in LoDo.  Hotel Row was anchored at either end by the luxurious Oxford Hotel near Union Station and the Brown Palace at Broadway.  The hotels in between were more modest.  Although they are not warehouses, these hotels are commercial style buildings.  So, architecturally, you can think of them as “warehouses for people”.</p>
            <p>The Saint Elmo Hotel opened in 1896.  It catered to railway workers and budget-conscious travelers.  Here is a photo of the hotel in its heyday.  Clearly this is a place for beer drinkers, not consumers of fine wines or fancy cocktails.  The saloon on the corner reflects the hotel’s clientele.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>The front of the hotel faces 17th Street, and resembles most of the warehouses that we have seen.  The ground floor has large windows by metal posts and beams.  The windows on the upper floors are smaller.  And there is a cornice on top. </p>
            <p>But there are some noticeable deviations from the warehouse pattern.  That cornice is unusually deep, and painted in a contrasting color.  The upper story windows are not set in recessed panels.  They are organized by protruding lines of brick.  There are lines that radiate upwards from each window.  These connect to horizontal lines that connect neighboring windows.  This brickwork, alone with the cornice and stone stringcourse between floors create a strong horizontal orientation.</p>
            <p>The corners of this building are not square.  The are cut at a 45 degree angle.  That’s called a chamfered corner.  There are corner entrances on the ground floor.  On the upper floors, more horizontal brick bands wrap around the corner.</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>The building across the street opened in 1882 as a warehouse for the Union Liquor Wholesale Company, which was owned by Moritz Barth.  It was designed by prominent Denver architect Frederick Eberley.</p>
            <p>This is our earliest example of adaptive reuse.  In the late 1880’s the Union Warehouse was converted to a 100 room hotel named the Union Hotel.  Why Union?  The hotel had a series of names and owners in subsequent decades.  In 1930 it was purchased by Alan Barth, the son of Moritz Barth.  He renamed it the Hotel Barth, and remodeled the entrance and lobby.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>This is another hotel that follows the pattern we have seen in warehouse buildings, but with some different and distinctive features.  Like the warehouses, the ground floor differs from the floors above, with larger windows framed in post and beam.  The is a tall stringcourse between the first floor and the upper floors.  The upper floors windows are arranged in five recessed panels.  And there is a cornice on top.</p>
            <p>So what is distinctive about this building?  But the upper does not have identical windows arranged in a grid.  Each floor has its own distinct pattern.  There is a method to the madness.  In your mind, draw a vertical line down the middle of the center recessed panel.  The middle section of the building is symmetric, mirror images on either side.</p>
            <p>The cornice is large with large brackets and what look like bird houses.  I thought that this was unique in Denver, until I looked down the street a block at the next hotel.  It has the same cornice.</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible">

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>The building across the intersection is the Oxford Hotel. It opened in 1891, and is Denver’s oldest surviving hotel.  It was designed by Frank Edbrooke, who next designed the Brown Palace at the other end of hotel row.  It had 400 rooms, with luxurious decorations and amenities. </p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>Again, we have a hotel that generally follows the warehouse pattern, but with some variations that give it a unique look.</p>
            <p>The first floor has large windows framed by posts and beams.  Here the structural steel is exposed, with decorations atop the posts.</p>
            <p>Unlike the last hotel, this one follows the usual pattern with windows arranged in a grid.  But they are not in recessed panels.  The windows that have rounded tops are not on the top floor.  And this building has terra cotta tiles at the top corners of each window.</p>
            <p>Instead of a cornice on top, this building has a parapet with alternating sections.  Some are lower, wider, and have protruding decorative brickwork.  The others are taller, narrower and plain.  This pattern give the impression of the top of a castle wall.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Annex</h3>
            <p>Look for the lighter colored building past this one.  In 1912 the hotel expanded by adding an annex on the far side of the alley.  It was designed by Montana Fallis and Robert Willison.  As you can see, it is completely different from the original.  This is not the LoDo commercial style.</p>
            <p><i>What makes this building look so different?</i></p>
            <p>The exterior is white terra-cotta finished to resemble marble, not red brick.  <i>Where have we seen this before?</i></p>
            <p>Above the ground floor the center projects out towards the street.  That has radial corners with matching curved windows.</p>
            <p>The ground floor has four large columns, with large brackets in the center that appear to support the projection.</p>
            <p>The top has an elaborately sculpted cornice with ornate paired brackets connected by rings.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Decline and Restoration</h3>
            <p>The hotel declined with the neighborhood during LoDo’s “skid row” period, becoming an overnight boarding house.  In 1979 it was purchased by Charles Calloway, who was joined by Dana Crawford the following year.  A three year, $12M restoration was completed in 1983.</p>

            <h3>Charles Boettcher</h3>
            <p>The building across the intersection opened in 1906 as the headquarters for the Great Western Sugar Company.  The business was founded by Charles Boettcher in 1901.  Boettcher was a German immigrant who become one of the leading businessmen in Denver.  He came to America at age 17.  He was a serial entrepreneur, who made his wealth in hardware stores, mining, banking, beet processing, cement production, railroads and hotels.</p>
            <p>In 1900 Boettcher went on vacation to his native Germany with his wife.  While there he visited several sugar beet farms, and recognized the potential for that crop back in Colorado.  He learned all he could during the trip about growing and processing sugar beets.   Legend has it that Boettcher took one of his wife’s luggage bags, emptied it, and filled it with sugar beet seed to take back to Colorado.  This new interest changed the course of Colorado’s economic history, especially for the eastern plains, where sugar beets could be grown in large quantities.  He founded the Great Western Sugar Company, which owned and operated beet-processing facilities opened across the plains.</p>
            <p>Those facilities were built using a concrete mix that was imported from Germany at great expense.  Boettcher decided to open his own cement company to produce high-quality cement locally.  The Ideal Cement Company building opened in 1907.  It was designed by Montana Fallis, made of concrete, and still survives, now called the Vault. </p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>The Sugar building was designed by Gove and Walsh.  It was initially four stories. Two stories were added later, giving it the proportions of a sugar cube.  This is two buildings in one.  The front half, facing 16th Street (left), was office space.  The back half, visible from Wazee Street (right) was a originally a warehouse, but was converted to office space in 1920.</p>
            <p>The front section follows the same pattern we have seen in previous buildings.  There are large plate glass windows on the first floor.  The windows in the floors above are arranged in recessed panels.  And there is a cornice on top.</p>
            <p>This building is more ornate that the others we have seen.  The original cornice atop the fourth floor was retained when the two upper floors were added.  And there are elaborate decorations between the windows on the fourth and sixth floors.</p>
            <p>The rear section is very different.  It uses darker brick.  The windows on the upper floors are narrower and more deeply recessed.  This gives the building a strong vertical orientation, like a Louis Sullivan skyscraper.  The front section has a balance of vertical and horizontal elements.</p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>That’s the Morey Mercantile building behind me, across the intersection.  That’s the same Morey Mercantile that moved into the Wazee Exchange building in 1884.  By the turn of the century, Morey Mercantile had almost 500 employees.  It also had  eighteen branches in Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico and Nebraska.  In 1902, Morey started the Solitaire Brand of quality canned goods, which became the company's top seller.  If you look closely at the top of the building, you can see a ghost sign for Solitaire.</p>
            <p>The company moved into this building in 1896.  It was designed by Gove and Walsh, who also designed the Brown Mercantile building that we saw two block down warehouse row.  In addition to warehouse space, it contained a spice grinding mill, roasting plant, extract laboratory and print shop.</p>
            <p>Morey’s son John started working for Morey Mercantile in 1901, and took over the business in 1913.Morey was also a partner in the Great Western Sugar Company, and became its second president when Charles Boettcher retired.</p>

            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>What is unusual about this building?  The main entrance is on the second floor!  That’s because 16th Street was a viaduct.  Show photo.  The building was connected to the viaduct by a short walkway.</p>
            <p>The ground floor was out of sight, beneath the viaduct.  So it does not have an entrance or large windows.  On this side, it has  horizontal lines created by inset courses in the brickwork.  Around the corner on the Wynkoop Street side there was a loading dock next to railroad tracks, like we saw at Brown Mercantile.</p>
            <p>On the upper floors, some of the windows are in recessed panels.  But the ones on the top floor and the ones at the sides are not.  Also, the top floor windows are smaller.</p>
            <p>The cornice is relatively deep, and there is a tallish parapet above.  That’s where the Solitaire ghost signs are.</p>

            <h3>Disuse and Reuse</h3>
            <p>In 1956 Morey Mercantile was acquired by Consolidated Foods.  The building entered a long period of decline.  In the 1994 the building was renovated by a group that included John Hickenlooper (of the Wynkoop Brewery) and Joyce Meskis of the Tattered Cover Book Store.  The Tattered Cover moved into the lower two floors, and the upper floors were converted to the Morey Mercantile Lofts.</p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>This building was built in 1906 for the Barteldes Seed Company.  That company was originally the Kansas Seed House, located in Lawrence, Kansas and owned by Friedo Barteldes.  In 1906 it changed its name to Barteldes, and expanded, adding locations in Oklahoma City and Denver.  In 1961 the company’s headquarters moved to Denver.</p>

            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>This building was also designed by Gove and Walsh.  It has several features in common with their Morey building across the street.  Its main entrance is on the second floor, and was originally connect to the viaduct by a short walkway.  Show photo.  The ground floor windows are aligned with, and the same size as, the second floor windows.  And the ground floor window have horizontal lines crated by inset courses in the brickwork.</p>
            <p>But this building has a couple unique features not seen in other Gove and Walsh designs.  The ground floor windows have sunburst lintels connected to the horizontal lines.  Where have we seen this before?  We saw this on the St. Elmo Hotel.</p>
            <p>Are the upper floor columns of windows arranged in inset panels, like we have seen on other buildings?  Actually, all of the upper floor windows are in a single panel, inset with a corralled border.</p>

            <h3>Adaptive Reuse</h3>
            <p>The building was occupied by various businesses during LoDo’s period of decline.  In 1987 it was transformed into a mixed use development, with residential lofts above offices.  The windows above the second floor were enlarged at that time.  You can see the smaller original windows in the old photo..</p>

            <h3>Two Patterns</h3>
            <p>What have we seen on this tour?  I would describe it as variations on a theme.  LoDo has a historical pattern and an architectural pattern.  The buildings we have seen follow those patterns, with many variations and a few exceptions.</p>
            <p>The historical pattern for LoDo consists of three periods: development, decline and transformation.  Most of the buildings we have seen were built in the late 1800’s and early 1900’s as warehouses and offices for wholesale companies.  In the decades after WWII they fell out of use.  Then, starting in the 1980’s they were transformed into loft residences above first floor restaurants and retail.  That is, they underwent adaptive reuse.</p>
            <p>The architectural pattern for LoDo is the organization of the exterior of buildings into three layers: bottom/middle/top.  The bottom is the first floor, with large windows for shops and restaurants.  The middle is the floors above, with columns of windows set in recessed panels.  The top is a cornice or parapet.</p>
            <p>So remember this pair of triplets: development/decline/transformation periods and bottom/middle/top layers.  If you do, you can amaze friends, family and visitors with your understanding of LoDo!</p>

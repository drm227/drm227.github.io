He returns to Boston briefly in 1827* and becomes one of the most noted writers of his time.  Poe's failure to win over the Boston literary audience, however, causes him to harbor hard feelings toward his hometown, and in 1845* he writes, 'We like Boston.  We were born there - and perhaps it is just as well not to mention that we are heartily ashamed of the fact. '  Poe dies in Baltimore on October 7, 1849.  The building in Boston in which he was born is torn down in 1959 and the site is currently a parking lot.  A plaque is subsequently erected nearby and a statue is installed on the site in 2014.*",

Designed in the Brutalist style and said to be modeled after the Minoan Palace at Knossos and the Monastery of Sante Marie de La Tourette in Lyon by Le Corbusier, it is located at 1 City Hall Plaza.  New York Times architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable calls it 'an instant image of progressive excellence on a city government traditionally known for something less than creativity and quality,' and calls it 'a structure of dignity, humanism and power [which] will outlast the last hurrah.'  Ground was broken on September 18, 1963.  At one of the week-long dedication events, Sen. Edward Kennedy warns that if Boston becomes 'a city lived in only by the very rich and the very poor . . . then our problems will overcome us.\u201d  At another, Kevin White declares 'this building exhorts all of us . . . to be hospitable to change, to try new ideas, to bring people closer to government.'  The Architectural Institute of America ranks it with Trinity Church as the sixth proudest achievement in the history of American architecture in 1976.",

Two 300-ton dampers had to be installed on the 58th floor to diminish the building's swaying in the wind.  Initially criticized for dwarfing smaller, historic structures in Copley Square, the building is subsequently hailed for its design.  Humorist poet Felicia Lamport writes, \u201c\u2018It\u2019s a constant delight to the viewer,\u2019 \/ As someone was recently saying, \/\u2019 And if the old vistas are fewer, \/ Well, that is the price I.

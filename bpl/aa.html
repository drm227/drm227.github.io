            <h3>Welcome</h3>
            <p>
                Welcome to the Boston Public Library!
                Why are we touring this building today?  What's so important about it?
            </p>
        </div>

            <h3>Leading Public Library</h3>
            <p>
                Two centuries ago there was not such thing as a public library, in Boston or anywhere in the country.
                Public libraries were a 19th century development.
                Boston played a leading role in the public library movement.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Boston Public Library was founded in 1852 (after enabling state law in 1848).
                It opened in 1854, in a former schoolhouse in downtown Boston.
                In 1858 the library to a new building designed specifically for it.
                That was on Boylston Street, across from the Boston Common, where the Colonial Theater is today.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was the first city library to bring books to the people in the neighborhoods where they lived, through delivery stations and later branch libraries.
                When the American Library Association was formed in 1876, they selected for their president the head librarian of the Boston Public Library.
                This was the first library to have a separate children's library.
                This leadership culminated in this building, which opened in 1895.
                This was the first large central library building in America to be significant for its architecture and art, as well as for the collection of books that it housed.
                It was called a "palace for the people".
            </p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Charles McKim</h3>
            <p>
                The library trustees chose Charles Follen McKim as the architect for the new library building.
                McKim was a founding partner in McKim, Mead and White, an architectural firm based in New York.
                Early in his career, McKim had worked for Heny Hobson Richardson on Trinity Church, which opened here in Copley Square in 1877.
                As we will see when we go outside, McKim chose a different architectural style for this library than Richardon had for the church.
            </p>
            <p>
                But McKim did faithfully copy one aspect of Trinity Church.
                Richardson had worked closely with artists and craftsmen to decorate the church.
                But as it says on the church's web site, "Despite its renowned artistry and architecture, Trinity Church is not a museum. Rather, it is a sacred place of worship".
                Richardson intended the architecture and art of the church building to reinforce its function as a church.
                That is, it should inspire people to worship and prayer.
            </p>
            <p>
                McKim attempted to do the same with this building.
                The architecture and art is intended to reinforce its function as a library.
                It should inspire people to read and learn.
                So as we look at the art and architecture of this building, think of how it contributes to that goal.
            </p>

            <h3>Vestibule Art</h3>
            <p>
                While we are here in the vestibule, let's look at the two pieces of art here.
                There are six bronze doors, two in each opening, by sculptor Daniel Chester French.
                Each is carved in low relief with an allegory, a representation of a concept associated with some aspect of the library's collection.
                These two represent Truth and Romance.  Think of non-fiction and fiction books.
                Each figure is holding an object that represents her attribute.
                Feel free to run your hand over one of these, to see how shallow the relief is.
            </p>
            <p>
                The statue at the other end of the vestibule is by Frederick MacMonnies.
                That is Sir Henry Vane, and English Puritan.
                He came to Boston during the Great Migration of the 1630's.
                He served a term as governor.  He was a supporter of Anne Hutchinson, and returned to England after her trial.
                He fought on the Parliamentary side of the English civil war.
                After the Restoration of the monarchy, he was tried and executed for treason.
                Strangely, Vane is shown here in Cavalier rather than Puritan attire.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Copley Square</h3>
            <p>
                Before we head outside, a word about the context for this libary building.
                We are in Copley Square, which is in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston.
                This is made land.  For two centuries, the Back Bay was part of the Charles River estuary.
                At hide tide it was under water.  At low tide it was mostly exposed mud flats and marshes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Back Bay was filled to create more land for a growing Boston.
                The landmaking project was run by the state, starting in the 1850's and finishing in the 1880's.
                From the beginning it was intended to create a residential neighborhood for affluent Bostonians.
                Copley Square became the location for cultural institutions supported by this elite.
                In 1880 the state granted this parcel of land to the city for a new library building.
                When this building opened in 1895, Copley Square was already the home of two museums (Natural History, Fine Arts), two schools (MIT, Harvard Medical), and two beautiful churches (Trinity, New Old South).
                The museums and schools have since moved away.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now let's go outside to look at the exterior of the building.

            <h3>Leading Public Library</h3>
            <p>
                Two hundred years ago there was no such thing as a public library, in Boston or any other American city or town.
                Public libraries in America were a 19th century development.  Boston was at the forefront of the movement.
                The Boston Public Library was founded in 1848.
                The BPF was the first municipally funded free public library.
                In 1855 it moved into a new buidling of its own.  That was on Boylston Street, across from the Common, where the Colonial Theater is today.
                When the American Library Association was founded in 18??, the librarian of the Boston Public Library was chosen to be its first president.
                The BPL was the first public library to bring books to its patrons in residential neighborhoods,

            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>
                Take a look at Trinity Church, and then turn around an look at the library.
                Richardson based his design on Romaneque cathedrals from the Medieval period.  McKim based his design on Renaisance palazzos.
                But even if you are not familiar with old architecture, you can see clear differences.
                The library facade is a simple rectangle.  The church has a much more complex shape.
                The row of windows and inscription above it give the library a horizontal orientation.  The towers pointing upwards give the church a vertical orientation.
                The library facade is made entirely of light gray Milford granite.  The church has several different types of stone with different colors.
            </p>
            <p>
                The library facade is divided into two sections.
                The upper facade contains the arcade of windows.  The lower facade contains the entrance to the building.
                The upper facade is more elaborately decorated than the lower section.  This is called peano nobile in architecture.
                By putting the emphasis on the upper part of the facade, McKim is giving us a clue as to which level of the interior is the most important space in the library.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Upper Facade</h3>
            <p>
                The upper facade contains 13 windows on this side of the building.
                The granite medallions in the spandrels between the windows contain the trademarks of early printers.  They were carved by Domingo Mora.
                The panels below ten of the windows are inscribed with the names of prominent figures in western culture.
                The spaces below the three center windows contain three seals: Massachusetts on the left, Boston on the right, and the BPL in the center.
                The library seal was carved the Augustus Saint-Gaudens.
                Saint-Gaudens was McKim's primary advisor on artistic matters for the library.
                The seal has two boys, holding torches and supporting a shield, with a motto in Latin above.
                It says "a light to all citizens".
                The shield contains an open book and the dates of the library.
                The boys are nude, which was controversial at the time.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Entrance</h3>
            <p>
                The three arched openings below the seals form the main entrance to the building.
                They have wrought iron gates.
                There are four branching, wrought iron lanterns in the spandrels of the openings.
                The outline these lanterns used to be used as a logo for the library.
                On the keystone for the center arch there is a bust of Minerva, Roman goddess of wisdom, by Domingo Mora.
                Above that, in raised letters, you see the phrase "free to all", taken from a letter by one of the libraries early benefactors.
            </p>
            <p>
                This entrance was used by the general public.
                There originally was a VIP entrance on the Boylston Street side, also having three arched openings.
                It was a porte-cochère, where carriages could enter to drop off or pick up passengers.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Statues</h3>
            <p>
                When the library opened in 1895, there were two plain granite blocks here.
                Saint-Gaudens had been given the commission for statues to be placed on top them.
                He sketched his idea for those statues, but did not complete them before his death in 1907.
                This will be a recurring theme in the tour.
                There was a problem with Saint-Gaudens plan: standing figures would interfere with the view of the facade behind them.
                Bela Pratt, a student of Saint-Gaudens, was later consulted.
                He proposed carving a notch in each block for a seated figure.
                His statues were installed here in 1912.  They represent Arts and Sciences.
                Each figure is surrounded by the names of prominent artists and scientists.

            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>
                This lobby is a Roman style design.
                It is divided into three aisles by heavy Iowa sandstone piers.
                The center aisle has an arched ceiling.  Each side aisle has three vaulted domes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note how different this lobby feels from the entrance we came through and the stairway we are heading towards.
                This space has less daylight.  It has less decoration.  The low ceiling and heavy piers make it feel confining compared to the entrance and stairway.
                Passing from lobby to stairway is like exiting a tunnel, which amplifies the visual impact of the stairway.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Decoration</h3>
            <p>
                The mosaics on the ceiling were installed by Italian craftsmen from the North End.
                These contain the names of thirty eminent Bostonians, 6 in the center arch and 24 in the vaulted domes along the sides.
            </p>
            <p>
                The floor is marble, with three brass inlays in the center passage.
                The one nearest the door has the signs of the zodiac.
                After that there is a seal of the library, with its "light for all citizens" motto.
                The inlay nearest the stairway contains the names of eight men who played prominent roles in the establishment and early years of the library.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Guastavino</h3>
            <p>
                The ceiling structure behind the mosaics is Guastavino vaulting.
                Rafael Guastavino was a Spanish building engineer who emigrated from Barcelona to the United States in 1881.
                He developed a construction technique based on the Catalan vault that became known as Guastavino vaulting, though he called it "cohesive construction".
                Guastavino used interlocking terracotta tiles sandwiched with thin layers of Portland cement.
                Guastavino's system had several advantages over conventional construction of the time.
                His vaulting was strong, lightweight, and fireproof.
            </p>
            <p>
                Guastavino was an entrpreneur trying to launch his product.
                He approached McKim in 1889, and offered to build the vaulting for the library in exchange for the iron beams that had been purchased but would be made unnecessary if his vaulting was used.
                McKim asked him to build a test arch, and loaded it with bricks to 500 psf.  It passed the test.  Today's building code for library floors is 150 psf.
                Guastavino was given a contract for $85,554 to do the tile arch work.
                The floor we are staning on, and the floor of the second level above us, rest on Guastavino vaults.
            </p>
            <p>
                Guastavino used eight variations of his vaulting in the library.
                You can see it on the ceilings of many of the rooms on this floor.  Take a look in the map room cafe after the tour.
                The library became a marketing tool for Guastavino.
                As early as 1891 he was using library construction photos in advertisements.
                He got more contracts, on more significant buildings, after his work on this building.

            <h3>Alexandre Vattemare</h3>
            <p>
                Look at the last name on the inlay nearest the stairway.
                Alexandre Vattemare was a Frenchman whose biography is one of those stranger than fiction stories.
                He had three careers.  First, he was briefly a surgeon in Paris.
                The he had a successful stage career as a ventriloquist, touring Europe with his one man show.
                He made enough money to retire from the stage and become an international philanthropist.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vattemare traveled Europe and North America promoting what he called a System of International Exchange.
                This was to be a reciprocal exchange of books and artifacts among the world's leading cultural instituions.
                He traveled to America in 1839 to promote the idea, and visited Boston during that trip.
                Here he received support from John Quincy Adams and Josiah Quincy.
                But his proposal to united the various private libraries in Boston under one roof as a free public library was unsuccessful.

                Despite that failure, Vattemare did arrange donations of books to Boston from Paris in the 1840's.
                He returned to Boston in 1847, and worked with Josiah Quincy Jr. on the campaign to pass the 1848 law enabling the formation of a public library for Boston.

                McKim spent a lot of time and money on this stairway (16 months, $70,000).
                The walls are yellow marble with black veining from Sienna in Italy.
                The color gradually changes from a darker to a lighter shade from bottom to top.
                Corresponding panels on either side have matching veining.
                The contractor complained that McKim was so particular that he had to buy ten times as much marble as was used.
            </p>
            <p>
                One art critic at the time observed that to McKim "building materials were to McKim what pigments are to the painter".
                One could say that McKim is painting in marble here.
            <p>
                The steps are made of ivory-gray French echaillon marble mottled with fossil shells.
                You can see a shell next to that railing support.
                This floor of this landing is inlaid with red-streaked Numidian marble from Africa.
                To some, the red streaks suggest the blood of the soldiers commemorated by these lions.

            <h3>Lions</h3>
            <p>
                The lions are a memorial to the men of the two Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry regiments who died in the Civil War.
                They were carved by Louis Saint-Gaudens, and installed in 1891.
                Below the lions are the names of the battles and campaigns in which the regiments participated.
            </p>
            <p>
                The lions are actually carved from blocks of the same Sienna marble that McKim used on the walls.
                McKim and Augustus Saint-Gaudens thought that the marble should be polished like the walls.
                But the scupltures were commissioned by the regiments, not the library.
                When the men of those regiments were so impressed by the lions that they insisted they be left as is.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is an inadvertently polished spot on each lion.
                People have reached out and touched the lion tails as they walk by.
                Take a look as we pass to see what the lions might have looked like if McKim had his way.
            </p>
            <p>
                But before we leave this spot, look at the figures painted on the wall of the hallway ahead.

            <h3>Artist &amp; Commission</h3>
            <p>
                McKim selected Pierre Puvis de Chavannes to do the murals for this space.
                Puvis was widely considered to be the greatest European muralist of the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                It took some persistence by McKim to get Puvis to accept the commission.
                Puvis was nearing 70 years old and already had plenty of work coming his way in France.
                There was no way he was going to travel to Boston.
                McKim visited Puvis twice in Paris twice before convincing him to take the job.
            </p>
            <p>
                McKim provided Puvis with a model, photographs and dimensions of the staircase and corridor.
                He also sent samples of the Sienna marble used on the walls.
                Puvis painted these mural on canvas in Paris, and exhibited there before being shipped to Boston.
                They were installed on the walls using a process called marouflage.
                Puvis never actually saw these murals here in the library.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now Puvis was a French artist painting for an American audience.
                He needed to use cultural references that would be understood by Americans.
                At that time, there were two bodies of literature that were universally known in western culture: the bible and the classics from ancient Greece and Rome.
                Puvis chose the classics.  In a letter to the library trustees he said
                "I have sought to represent under a symbolic form and in a single view the intellectual treasures collected in this beautiful building."
            </p>
            <p>
                The colors in the murals appear muted.  This was intentional, not the result of fading.
                Puvis wanted to make these murals look like frescoes.
                He used light colors with an unvarnished surface.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Muses</h3>
            <p>
                Puvis called this large mural <em>The Muses of Inspiration Welcoming the Spirit of Light</em>.
                It depicts the nine muses of Greek mythology floating up to greet a youth representing the spirit of enlightenment.
                It alludes to the lbrary's motto in its seal: a light to all citizens.
                But unlike the seal, this figures nudity is covered.
            </p>
            <p>
                Puvis originally intended for the muses to be standing on the ground.
                But in that position, they could not be seen from the landing below.
                So he elevated them into the air.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two figures on either side of the doorway represent study and contemplation.
                The arrangement suggests that study and contemplation can lead to enlightenment,
                and that the room on the other side of the doorway is a place for those activities.
                However, on one tour a child remarked that the figures were using an iPad and an iPhone.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mural is 20 feet high and 40 feet long.
                It was done in two pieces, left and right.
                The seam is above the right side of the doorway.

            <h3>Staircase Murals</h3>
            <p>
                The murals around the staircase represent categories of literature and science
                that would be found in the library's card catalog.
                Each is represented using figures from the classical literature and art.
            </p>
            <p>
                The three murals on the south wall represent philosophy, astronomy, and history.
                Philosophy shows Plato teaching in Athens.
                Astronomy shows shepards gazing at the stars.
                History is a figure calling up the past.
            </p>
            <p>
                The three murals on the north wall represent three kinds of poetry: pastoral, dramatic and epic.
                Homer represents epic poetry, Aeschylus dramatic, and Virgil pastoral.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two murals on the far wall are Chemistry and Physics.
                Chemistry uses pre-scientific imagery: a fairy using a magic wand to perform some chemical transformation.
                Physics contains the only modern touch.  Messengers carrying good and bad news travel along electric wires.

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Joshua Bates</h3>
            <p>
                The hall is named after Joshua Bates, a great benefactor to the library.
                Bates was born and raised in the Boston area in the late 18th century.  There were no public libraries at the time.
                But a local book seller allowed the young Bates to sit in his shop and read without buying anything.
                Early in his career in finance Bates moved to London.  He joined Baring Brothers and rose to be managing partner of one of the leading investment banks in the world at the time.  He rose to become managing partner.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1852, when he learned about the formation of the Boston Public Library, he sent an unsolicited offer to the Mayor of Boston.
                He volunteered to donate $50,000 for the library, to be used to buy books.  The offer did come with three conditions:
                the building should be an "ornament to the city",
                it should have a room to seat 100-150 people at reading tables,
                it should be "free to all".
                It seems like Bates fondly remembered his time in that bookshop, and wanted everyone in Boston to have the same opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the previous library building opened in 1858, its largest room was named Bates Hall.
                The name was transferred to the largest room in this building when it opened in 1895.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>
                Bates Hall runs the length of the Copley Square side of the building.
                The room is 218 ft long, 42.5 ft wide, and 50 ft tall.
                The ceiling is a barrel vault.  Four heavy arches support the ceiling.
                At both ends of the room, the barrel vault terminates in a vaulted half dome.
                The walls are made of sandstone from Amherst, Ohio.
            </p>
            <p>
                The windows that we saw from the outside are on the far wall.
                There are also windows in the half dome on the south side, which is to your right as you enter.
                In the north half dome there is a large panel instead of windows.
                On the near wall there a blind arches corresponding to the windows, except for the center one.
                Opposite that, above this entrance, there is a balcony carved from Indiana limestone.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Decoration &amp; Fittings</h3>
            <p>
                The hall is surrounded by English oak bookcases 10 feet tall, sitting on a base of red Verona marble.
                The reading tables are original, but power outlets have been added.
                The the original chairs and reading lamps have been replaced.
            </p>
            <p>
                The doorways to adjoining rooms are elaborately framed with black Belgian and Alps green serpentine marble.
                There is also a pair of fireplaces along the near wall, with mantles of sandstone and red Verona marble.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only art you will see are white marble busts of great authors and eminent Bostonians.
                McKim intended to have murals on the panel in the north half dome, and in the blind arches.
                McKim and Saint-Gaudens selected Whistler to paint a mural for the panel.
                But contract negotiations broke down, and the panel remained blank.
                McKim discussed a commission for the arches with LaFarge, who had done the murals form Trinity Church, but nothing came of that.
                When we walk through the room, think about how it might look if there were murals in those spaces.

            <h3>Delivery Room</h3>
            <p>
                This was originally the Delivery Room, where you would request and receive books.
                This was a closed stack library.  You didn't just browse the books on the shelves and pick one out.
                To get a book, you would first look it up in the card catalog.  That was located next door, at the north end of Bates Hall.
                You copied information from the card on to a request slip, and brought the slip to a librarian in here.
                The librarian would send the slip to the appropriate location in the stacks via pneumatic tube.
                A librarian in the stack would get the book from the shelves, and send it down here via a system of tracks and book elevators.
                Then it would be handed over to you.  While all this was happening, patrons waited in this room.
            </p>
            <p>
                This room has a darker color scheme than the other rooms we have come through.
                The decorations are reminiscent of the Doge's Palace in Venice.
                The ceiling has large beams, decorated with ornaments.
                The upper walls are occupied by a sequence of murals that are eight feet tall.
                The lower walls are covered in dark oak paneling.
                The doorways are elaborately framed with columns and entablatures of blood red rouge antique marble.
                The floor has contrasting squares of gray Istrian and red Verona marble.

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Artist &amp; Commission</h3>
            <p>
                McKim chose Edwin Austin Abbey to do the murals for this room.
                It was a surprising choice, since Abbey worked as an illustrator for books and magazines, not a painter.
                But he was recommended by St. Gaudens.  And it did not hurt that he was engaged to a neice of the Mead in McKim, Mead and White.
                Abbey was an American who had taken up residence in London.  He painted the murals there, and they were shipped here for installation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Abbey chose for his subject the story of Galahad and his quest for the Holy Grail.
                The legend goes back to medieval times.
                It was popularized in the 19th century by Tennyson's <em>Idylls of the King</em>.
                You can think of it as a book illustration, but as murals on the walls of the library.
                It gave patrons something to read while waiting for their books.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are 15 murals of varying width.
                The first five were installed in 1895, after being exhibited in London.
                The other 10 in were installed in 1902, after being exhibited in London and New York
            </p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Mural Sequence</h3>
            <p>
                The sequence of 15 murals starts and ends the the far corner.
                In the first mural, on the right side of the corner, the infant Galahad is visited by an angel bearing the Grail.
                In last mural, on the left side of the corner, Galahad, now king of Sarras, builds a golden tree and takes possession of the Grail.
                The murals in between show various episodes in his quest, in order.
                I'm not going to go into those.  If you are interested, I encourage you to come back and use the printed guides to the murals hanging there.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can easily identify Galahad in each mural.  He is the figure wearing red.
                Red symbolized his purity, which was the characteristic required for the knight who would attain the Grail.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the final mural, Abbey uses gilding and relief to depict the tree and Grail.
            </p>
            <p>
                These murals widely acclaimed.  According to one critic,
                "it soon became the most popular mural cycle in America, and as such it made Abbey's reputation as a painter"

            <h3>Inspirational?</h3>
            <p>
                The story of Galahad and the Quest for the Grail was well known to library patrons in the 1890's.
                How many of you had heard of it before coming here?  Did you recognize it in these murals?
                If Abbey were working in our times, what might he have chosen for his subject?  Harry Potter?

                McKim selected John Singer Sargent to do the murals for this space.
                Sargent was born in Europe in 1856 to American parents.
                He began his training as an artist in Paris in 1874, and also spent his early career there.
                Sargent moved to London in 1884.  He traveled to New York and Boston in 1887-88.
                His first solo exhibition was actually here in Boston in 1888.

                By the time McKim approached him in 1890, he was an established portrait painter.
                Painting portraits was lower on the the artistic pecking order than painting murals.
                So Sargent welcomed the opportunity to create a large mural program that would establish his reputation as a serious artist.

            <h3>Triumph of Religion</h3>
            <p>
                Sargent chose the history religion in western civilization as the subject for the murals.
                He called the murals in this hall the <em>Triumph of Religion.</em>
                You might wonder why there is religious art here in the library, which is a secular, civic building.
                But this is not religious art in the way that the LaFarge murals are in Trinity Church.
                Sargent intended these murals to be educational, not devotional.
            </p>
            <p>
                They express a view of the history of religion that he learned in France, based mostly on the writings of Ernest Renan.
                According to Renan, religion in western civilization had progressed from primitive and materialist superstition, on to institutional religion with ritual and dogma, and then finally to a more advanced and subjective spirituality.
                Sargent is describing what happened in history, not advocating any particular religious belief.
                According to one observer, "Sargent's approach to religion was quintessentially modern, democratic, and American",
                based on "the conviction that religion is an interior matter, to be determined solely and freely by the individual".

            <h3>Installations</h3>
            <p>
                Sargent worked on these murals from 1890 to 1919.  They were installed in four phases.
                The north wall and ceiling vault were installed in 1895.
                The south wall was installed in 1903.
                The south ceiling vault and the lunettes on the east and west walls were installed in 1916.
                The two panels on either end of the stairway were installed in 1919.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you can see, there is a large, prominent, empty panel, like we saw in Bates Hall.
                He had planned to paint the <em>Sermon on the Mount</em> there, which he regarded as the "keynote" for the room.
                But he never did.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sargent had suffered a couple personal setbacks.
                One of the panels in the 1919 installation was widely criticized.  More about the when we look at those panels.
                Also, Sargent's beloved niece and model was killed in a bombardment near the end of WWI.
                More significantly, the entire historical narrative on which Sargent based the Triumph of Religion was no longer so compelling after WWI.
                The death and destruction inflicted by mankind on itself during the war discredited the notion of the progress of western civilization, especially in the moral realm.
                It was obvious that religion had not triumphed.
                Sargent died in London in 1925.

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>North End</h3>
            <p>
                We are going to look at the murals in the order in which they were installed, starting here at the north side which was installed in 1895.
                Here Sargent draws from the Tanakh, what Christians call the Old Testament.
                These murals are arranged in three sections:
                a ceiling representing polytheism,
                a lunette representing monotheism,
                and a frieze representing the Law and the Prophets.
                Sargent said that sequence represents "the progress of belief towards a more spiritual idea".
            </p>
            <p>
                The ceiling panel depicts three pagan gods.
                On the left is Moloch, a human figure with a bull's head.  Moloch was a Canaanite god associated with humand sacrifice.
                The sun is above his head "with rays reaching down to draw forth the earth's bounty".
                Opposite Moloch on the right is Astarte, goddess of fertility, wearing blue and standing on a crescent moon.
                In the background, spanning the arch, is Neith, Egyptian goddess of creation.  Her legs are behind Moloch and extended arms behind Astarte.
                Above, in center of the arch, you can see her gold neckplate with the signs of the zodiac.  Her face is to the right, with a scarab above her eyes.
                There is a gold band between the gods and the north wall, inscribed with and excerpt from Psalm 106.
                "They shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and their daughters unto the idols of Canaan".
            </p>
            <p>
                The lunette shows the Israelites between two of their oppressors.
                The Egyptian pharaoh on the left and Assyrian king on the right have their arms raised to strike the Israelites.
                The Israelites are huddled in the lower center, and one of them has his arms uplifted in prayer for deliverance.
                Their Lord is above, mostly hidden by the wings of angels.  His arms reach out to stay oppressors.
                Prostrate victims beneath the feet of both Assyrian and Egyptian represent the other nations that were oppressed by them, while behind each are figures symbolizing the national deities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moses is at the center of the frieze, holding the tablets he brought down from Mount Sinai.
                This "symbolized the foundation of the religion of Israel upon the structure of the Law."
                He is flanked by "the prophets in whom religion became subjective".  Their names appear in Hebrew above each figure.
                According to Renan, the prophets brought "the introduction of morality into religion".
            </p>
            <p>
                Now look again at all three sections in order.  What does Sargent do differently as you go from top to bottom?
                The size of the figures descreases from the gods to the human scale prophets.
                The gods are symbolic, the prophets are realistic.
                The amount of relief and decoration decreases from the gods and opppressors down to the prophets.
                It is everywhere on the ceiling arch, on the left and right in the lunette, and only in the center of the frieze.
                The prophets are realistic figures in two dimensions.
                This visually expresses the progression from material to spiritual in the history of religion.

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>
                McKim's design for this courtyard was based on the Palazzo della Cancelleria in Rome.
                The arcades here are exactly the same height as those in the Rome.
                But the Palazzo had arcades on all four sides of the courtyard.
                Here, there is no arcade on the east side because the building extends into the courtyard.
                That is for the stairway we walked up earlier.
                The doorway on the stairway landing leads to that balcony.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Bacchante and Infant Faun</h3>
            <p>
                McKim decided to put a fountain in the center of the courtyard.
                Originally, he intended for it to contain a simple water jet.
                But he later decided to put a statue in the fountain.
                Before he could select an artist and negotiate a commission, a gift appeared on his doorstep.
                Back in 1884, McKim had helped to finance a young artist to travel to Paris and study there.
                That was MacMonnies, the sculptor who later did the statue of Henry Vane that we saw in the vestibule.
                To express his gratitude for that support, in 189? MacMonnies offered McKim a statue that he was working on.
                McKim decided to donate it to the library and place it in the fountain.
            </p>
            <p>
                The statue, called <em>Bacchante and Infant Faun</em> was widely praised in artistic circles.
                The woman is a bacchante, a follower of Bacchus, the Greek god of wine in classical mythology.
                Macmonnies sculpted her in motion, not standing still.  He captured her energy and joi de vivre.
            </p>
            <p>
                But many Bostonians saw something else when they viewed the statue.
                McKim and Macmonnies had inadvertently stumbled into a culture war in Boston.
                The Boston Public Library was one of the institutions created in the 19th by the elite, the so-called Brahmins, to propogate thier view of what Boston should be.
                They viewed the library as one means to assimilate and uplift the waves of immigrants coming to Boston.
                The temperance movement was another part of that program.
                Many of the people sharing this view looked at the statue and saw, not a bacchante and infant faun, but a naked inebriated women setting a bad example for her infant child.
                In today's terms, imagine the controversy that would ensue if the library announced that it was going to install a statue of a Confederate general here.
                Eventually, McKim withdrew his offer, and donated the statue to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
                The fountain would have no statue, just the simple water jet that McKim originally planned.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fast forward to the 1990's.  The libary was approaching the 100th anniversary of the building.  A major restoration project was starting up.
                The library decided that it had made a mistake in the 1890's, and that this courtyard would be better with the Macmonnnies statue.
                They approached the Met about getting it back, but was rejected.
                Now, three copies of the statue were cast from the original molds: the one that Mamonnies gave to McKim, one that the government of France commissioned for a museum in Luxemburg, and one for a private collector in America.
                That last one was eventually donated to the Museum of Fine Arts here in Boston.
                The library arranged with the MFA for a copy to be made in 1993.  It was installed here in 2000 as part of the restoration project.
            </p>
            <p>
                End of story, everyone in happy.
                Except possibly for General Francis Walker.
                In 1896, he was president of MIT and a library trustee.  He had opposed having Bacchante and Infant Faun in the library.
                One of the four memorials in this courtyard is to Walker.  His bust is on the wall behind you.
                Now he has to look at the statue all day, every day.

            <h3>Second Building</h3>
            <p>
                This building opened in 1972.
                It was designed by architect Philip Johnson.
                Since it opened, the two buildings are referred to by their architects' names: the McKim building and the Johnson building.
                The library's circulating collection moved here to the Johnson.  The McKim building holds reference materials and special collections.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>
                Johnson designed this building in the modern style.
                The essence of Modernism was Louis Sullivan's famous dictum that "form follows function".
                Its goal was simplicity and clarity of forms, and elimination of "unnecessary detail".
                So this building is was very plain compared to the McKim building, by design.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Similarities</h3>
            <p>
                But there are some fundamental similarities between the two buildings.
                The Johnson building is the same size and shape as the McKim buidling.
                The exterior is the same Milford granite as the McKim building
                Both have a large open space in the middle.  The McKim building has a courtyard.  This building has an atrium with skylights.
                If you look at this building from across the street, you will see that is has three large arches spanning the facade, reminiscent of the three arched openings of the entrance to the McKim building.

        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Renovation</h3>
            <p>
                In 2017 the library completed a $78M renovation of the Johnson Building.
                It was designed by local architect William Rawn.
                The building is now more open to the street.  Originally there were granite plynths between the sidewalk and the building.  There were removed.
                The interior is also more open.  You can see from end to end here, in both directions.  The effect is more dramatic on the second floor.
                It is also more colorful.  The decorations use a color scheme based on murals in the McKim building.  That mural made of books uses colors from the Puvis murals in the McKim stairway.
            </p>
            <p>
                The lobby here now has a studio for WGBH, and a cafe.
                There are classrooms and meeting rooms on the mezzanine.
                The Children's library and Teen library are on the second floor.
            </p>
            <p>
                The net effect has been to change people's perception of the Johnson building.
                The original building was not a "palace for the people" like the McKim building.
                I loved the McKim building.  It made me happy to be there.  The Johnson building did not have that effect on people.
                But the renovation changed that.  This building is now just as attractive to patrons as the McKim building.
                Last year the renovation won the Boston Society of Architect's Parkman Medal, which is given annually to recognize the "most beautiful piece of architecture in the Boston area".

                Please do explore the library.  I recommend checking out the Children's Library on the second level of this building.

            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>
                This addition to the central library was completed in 1972.
                It was designed by architect Philip Johnson in the modern style.
                Modern architecture strove for simplicity and clarity of form, and elimination of "unnecessary detail".
                So the Johnson building is the opposite of the McKim building, at least in terms of decoration.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the Johnson building does have much in common with the McKim building.
                It is very close in size and shape to the McKim building, both in footprint and height.
                Its exterior is the same granite as the McKim building.
                Its facade is dominated by three large arches, echoing the three arches of the McKim building entrances, on a larger scale.
                It also has a large, open central space.  The atrium in the Johnson building corresponds to the courtyard in the McKim building.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the Johnson building opened, the library's circulating collection move there.
                The McKim building  housed only the reference collections.

            <h3>Renovation</h3>
            <p>
                In 2016 the library completed a $78M renovation of the Johnson building, affecting 156,000 square feet.
                The architect for the project was William Rawn Associates.
            </p>
            <p>
                The building was opened up to the street.
                The stone plinths barrier around the first floor was removed.
                You can now see the interior from the street, and vice versa, through the glass walls.
                The color scheme is based on the murals in the McKim building.
            </p>
            <p>
                A cafe and WGBH studio were installed in the lobby.
                The mezanine contains new meeting rooms and the Community Learning Center classroom.
                The second floor has the new Children's Library and Teen Central room.
                The Rabb Auditorium in the the basement was updated.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I first visited the BPL, I loved the McKim building.  It made me happy to be there.
                The Johnson building did not have that affect.  It's not that I actively disliked the building.
                It was just a place you went when you needed something that was kept there.
                The renovation changed that.  Now the Johnson building is just as attractive as the McKim building.
                In 2017 the project won the BSA's Parker Medal, an annual award which recognizes “the most beautiful piece of architecture, building, monument or structure within the City or Metropolitan Parks District limits.”

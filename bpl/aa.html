            <h3>Leading Public Library</h3>
            <p>
                Two hundred years ago there was no such thing as a public library, in Boston or any other American city or town.
                Public libraries in America were a 19th century development.  Boston was at the forefront of the movement.
                The Boston Public Library was founded in 1848.
                The BPF was the first municipally funded free public library.
                In 1855 it moved into a new buidling of its own.  That was on Boylston Street, across from the Common, where the Colonial Theater is today.
                When the American Library Association was founded in 18??, the librarian of the Boston Public Library was chosen to be its first president.
                The BPL was the first public library to bring books to its patrons in residential neighborhoods,

            <h3>Sargent</h3>
            <p>
                McKim selected John Singer Sargent to do the murals for this space.
                Sargent was born in Europe in 1856 to American parents.
                He began his training as an artist in Paris in 1874, and also spent his early career there.
                Sargent moved to London in 1884.  He traveled to New York and Boston in 1887-88.
                His first solo exhibition was actually here in Boston in 1888.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the time McKim approached him in 1890, he was an established portrait painter.
                Painting portraits was lower on the the artistic pecking order than painting murals.
                So Sargent welcomed the opportunity to create a large mural program that would establish his reputation as a serious artist.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Triumph of Religion</h3>
            <p>
                Sargent chose the history religion in western civilization as the subject for the murals.
                He called the murals in this hall the <em>Triumph of Religion.</em>
                You might wonder why there is religious art here in the library, which is a secular, civic building.
                But this is not religious art in the way that the LaFarge murals are in Trinity Church.
                Sargent intended these murals to be educational, not devotional.
            </p>
            <p>
                They express a view of the history of religion that he learned in France, based mostly on the writings of Ernest Renan.
                According to Renan, religion in western civilization had progressed from primitive and materialist superstition, on to institutional religion with ritual and dogma, and then finally to a more advanced and subjective spirituality.
                Sargent is describing what happened in history, not advocating any particular religious belief.
                According to one observer, "Sargent's approach to religion was quintessentially modern, democratic, and American",
                based on "the conviction that religion is an interior matter, to be determined solely and freely by the individual".
            </p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Installations</h3>
            <p>
                Sargent worked on these murals from 1890 to 1919.  They were installed in four phases.
                The north wall and ceiling vault were installed in 1895.
                The south wall was installed in 1903.
                The south ceiling vault and the lunettes on the east and west walls were installed in 1916.
                The two panels on either end of the stairway were installed in 1919.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you can see, there is a large, prominent, empty panel, like we saw in Bates Hall.
                He had planned to paint the <em>Sermon on the Mount</em> there, which he regarded as the "keynote" for the room.
                But he never did.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sargent had suffered a couple personal setbacks.
                One of the panels in the 1919 installation was widely criticized.  More about the when we look at those panels.
                Also, Sargent's beloved niece and model was killed in a bombardment near the end of WWI.
                More significantly, the entire historical narrative on which Sargent based the Triumph of Religion was no longer so compelling after WWI.
                The death and destruction inflicted by mankind on itself during the war undermined the notion of the progress of western civilization, especially in the moral realm.
                It was obvious that religion had not triumphed.
                Sargent died in London in 1925.

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>North End</h3>
            <p>
                We are going to look at the murals in the order in which they were installed, starting here at the north side which was installed in 1895.
                Here Sargent draws from the Tanakh, what Christians call the Old Testament.
                These murals are arranged in three sections:
                a ceiling representing polytheism,
                a lunette representing monotheism,
                and a frieze representing the Law and the Prophets.
                Sargent said that sequence represents "the progress of belief towards a more spiritual idea".
            </p>
            <p>
                The ceiling panel depicts three pagan gods.
                On the left is Moloch, a human figure with a bull's head.  Moloch was a Canaanite god associated with humand sacrifice.
                The sun is above his head "with rays reaching down to draw forth the earth's bounty".
                Opposite Moloch on the right is Astarte, goddess of fertility, wearing blue and standing on a crescent moon.
                In the background, spanning the arch, is Neith, Egyptian goddess of creation.  Her legs are behind Moloch and extended arms behind Astarte.
                Above, in center of the arch, you can see her gold neckplate with the signs of the zodiac.  Her face is to the right, with a scarab above her eyes.
                There is a gold band between the gods and the north wall, inscribed with and excerpt from Psalm 106.
                "They shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and their daughters unto the idols of Canaan".
            </p>
            <p>
                The lunette shows the Israelites between two of their oppressors.
                The Egyptian pharaoh on the left and Assyrian king on the right have their arms raised to strike the Israelites.
                The Israelites are huddled in the lower center, and one of them has his arms uplifted in prayer for deliverance.
                Their Lord is above, mostly hidden by the wings of angels.  His arms reach out to stay oppressors.
                Prostrate victims beneath the feet of both Assyrian and Egyptian represent the other nations that were oppressed by them, while behind each are figures symbolizing the national deities.

                Moses is at the center of the frieze, holding the tablets he brought down from Mount Sinai.
                This "symbolized the foundation of the religion of Israel upon the structure of the Law."
                He is flanked by "the prophets in whom religion became subjective".  Their names appear in Hebrew above each figure.
                According to Renan, the prophets brought "the introduction of morality into religion".

                Now look again at all three sections in order.  What does Sargent do differently as you go from top to bottom?
                The size of the figures descreases from the gods to the human scale prophets.
                The gods are symbolic, the prophets are realistic.
                The amount of relief and decoration decreases from the gods and opppressors down to the prophets.
                It is everywhere on the ceiling arch, on the left and right in the lunette, and only in the center of the frieze.
                The prophets are realistic figures in two dimensions.
                This visually expresses the progression from material to spiritual in the history of religion.
